            "info": "<a class='name' name='Tylin'>Tylin Quintara Mitsobar</a>, p. 334 (380)&#x2014;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara, Mistress of the Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar. Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was governed by nobles who are not necessarily loyal to her. She was the second from her House to sit on the throne&#x2014;this is the maximum traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell so fast from power that it could not recover. She was advised by <a href='#Merilille'>Merilille Ceandevin</a> of the Gray Ajah. She is a widow, and does not plan to marry again. However, she took an interest in <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat&apos;s usual tactic of chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>. The two have been lovers for some time now, although Mat is not certain he could get out of the relationship should he see dire need to. When the Seanchan invaded her nation, she cooperated with them out of necessity&#x2014;they let her keep her position of authority, but is now a puppet of the Crystal Throne. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>.
