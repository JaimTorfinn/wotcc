When <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> came to Shadar Logoth to set wards on the Waygate there, Liah got separated from the group and was never found. Presuming she was dead, Rand took the group back to Caemlyn. When Rand returned to Shadar Logoth weeks later to fight Sammael, he discovered that Liah was still alive, if not completely sane anymore. He killed her with balefire when she was attacked by Mashadar. "
