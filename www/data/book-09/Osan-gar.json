It was the left-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore. The sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers. Osan&apos;gar states that he helped make the Trollocs, indicating that in his past life he was Aginor. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a>; <a href='#Dashiva'>Dashiva, Corlan</a>. "
