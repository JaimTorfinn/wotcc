She is plump but tough. She and her friend since novicehood, <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine</a>, are now leading a hunt for Darkfriends in the Tower. Seaine approached her not only because they were friends, but because Seaine&apos;s family was killed by Darkfriends when she was young. She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family and others like them. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Seaine'>Herimon, Seaine</a>.
