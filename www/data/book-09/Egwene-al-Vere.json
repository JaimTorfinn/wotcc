            "info": "<a class='name' name='Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, p. 25 (14)&#x2014;A young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>. She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, Galad and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene shows promise to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene has recently enlisted <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a> as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove Elaida from power. She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history&#x2014;in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Marin'>al&apos;Vere, Marin</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>; <a href='#Nynaeve'>ti al&apos;Meara Mandragoran, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
