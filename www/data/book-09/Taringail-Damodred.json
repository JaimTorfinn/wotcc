His first wife, Tigraine, the then Daughter-Heir of Andor, bore him a son, Galad, before she vanished, causing the War of Succession. After the war was over, he married <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase Trakand</a>, the new Queen. Taringail and Morgase had two children, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. He died when Elayne was barely old enough to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase; unbeknownst to her, he had planned to engineer her death and make himself the first King of Andor in a millenium. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
