            "info": "<a class='name' name='Aludra'>Aludra</a>, p. 330 (375)&#x2014;Illuminator from Tarabon with dark, waist-length hair, large dark eyes, and a plump mouth. She was involved with the fireworks display for King Galldrian of Cairhien that went awry when Trollocs came. She was blamed for its failure, although she believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame. She was cast out of the Illuminators&apos; Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her. She was saved by <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and <a href='#Thom'>Thom</a> in a barn, and as a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks. She is now in Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder. <i>Note: it is widely speculated that Aludra is looking for a bellfounder for a specific reason: she wants to build a cannon.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>.
