He is allegedly from a farm in the Black Hills. He always seems to have his head in the clouds, and speaks the Old Tongue fluently. He was among the Asha&apos;man who tried to kill Rand. <i>Note: Dashiva&apos;s fluent speaking of the Old Tongue is an unusual trait. The only other non-Forsaken to speak the Old Tongue fluently are <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>. Based on this and other pieces of evidence, many have suggested that Dashiva is actually our friend <a href='#Osangar'>Osan&apos;gar</a>, the reincarnation of Aginor. RAFO (read and find out).</i> "
