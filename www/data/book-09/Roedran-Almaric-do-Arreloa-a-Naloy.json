In reality, Murandians hold allegiance to lords only, and those lords often refuse to pay their taxes to the King. He hopes to make himself the first <i>true</i> king of Murandy in its history. <i>In the paperback edition, Roedran&apos;s name is replaced by <a href='#Ailron'>Ailron</a>&apos;s name at this point in the book, so it would appear that this is a misprint.</i> "
