Aran&apos;gar was the right-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore. The sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers. The other Forsaken consider Balthamel&apos;s new body a fine joke; the soul of Balthamel now occupies the body of a beautiful young woman. She still channels <i>saidin</i>, and now serves as Delana&apos;s maid. Delana does not know that she is one of the Chosen reincarned, just that she stands far above her among the Darkfriends. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Osangar'>Osan&apos;gar</a>; <a href='#Halima'>Saranov, Halima</a>.
