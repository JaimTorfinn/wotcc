She is <a href='#Toram'>Toram Riatin</a>&apos;s sister, and will do anything for him if he asked her to. She is tall for a Cairhienin woman (and <i>only</i> for a Cairhienin woman&#x2026;). She had pledged for <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, but disappeared after the attack by Asha&apos;man. The last Rand saw her, she was bound with the Power under a bed. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Toram'>Riatin, Toram</a>. "
