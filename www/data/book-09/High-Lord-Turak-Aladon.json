He was killed there when <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> bested him in a swordfight. He was a Blademaster, and was quite stunned when Rand was able to match him. He kept a collection of rare <i>cuendillar</i> objects, including (thanks in part to looting Bayle Domon&apos;s ship) two seals on the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s prison. Both of these seals broke when the Seanchan were pushed back into the sea. "
