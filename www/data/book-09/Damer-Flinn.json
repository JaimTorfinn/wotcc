He is bald with a fringe of white hair around the edge of his head. He was in the Queen&apos;s Guards until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired to help people with injuries. He came for the amnesty to see if he could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of Legends. He managed to partially Heal <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s wound in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does not seep into it anymore. Since he was placed on <a href='#Taim'>Taim</a>&apos;s Traitors&apos; List, he has been in hiding&#x2014;he did not assist in the attack on <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, but Rand thinks it better to be safe than to have him killed.
