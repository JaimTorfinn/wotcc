His name means &#x201C;Death&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name more. He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have already appeared in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the <i>saa</i> appeared). Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the Pattern to behave how he wants it to&#x2014;he knows that with someone as strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, that is all but impossible, not to mention foolish. Instead, he attempts to keep everything in chaos (as per the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s command, &#x201C;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&#x201D;), hoping that subtle manipulations will further his goals. He has been declared <a href='#Naeblis'>Nae&apos;blis</a>, the one to be second only to the Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the <i>cour&apos;souvra</i> controlling the minds of <a href='#Cyndane'>Cyndane</a> and <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>. He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True Power&#x2014;the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even should they want to. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>; <a href='#Naeblis'>Nae&apos;blis</a>.
