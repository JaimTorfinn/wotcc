She has long blonde hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the best with bow and arrows in all human history. During <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was ripped out of <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> and almost died. She would have if she had not been saved by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, who bonded her as a Warder to give her the strength and quick healing she needed to survive. She is always linked to Gaidal Cain in the stories, and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was ripped out. She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed to be like. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>ti al&apos;Meara Mandragoran, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Trahelion'>Trahelion, Birgitte</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
