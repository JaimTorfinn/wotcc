Originally a <i>sul&apos;dam</i>, she was intended to be the Leash Holder for <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> when she and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> were given to Suroth by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>. She was later promoted to a Voice of the Blood, the first <i>sul&apos;dam</i> to ascend to the Blood. However, it was thought unwise to leave her as a simple <i>sul&apos;dam</i>; she found <a href='#Renna'>Renna</a> and <a href='#Seta'>Seta</a>, collared and helpless, and brought them to Suroth. Suroth hid them for the good of the Empire, and promoted Alwhin to a Voice of the Blood. "
