            "info": "<a class='name' name='Verin'>Verin Mathwin</a>, p. 287 (325)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah who accompanied <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> back from Falme to Tar Valon. Her Warder is named <a href='#Tomas'>Tomas</a>. She is more interested in current events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened now, only what happened years ago. She gave Egwene the twisted stone ring <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway. When Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href='#Alanna'>Alanna</a>, they helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>&apos;s sister <a href='#Bode'>Bode</a>. When she and Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town. Verin is quite old&#x2014;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means she is quite old indeed. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tomas'>Tomas</a>. "
