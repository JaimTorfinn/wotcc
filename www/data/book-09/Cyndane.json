She is actually Lanfear reincarnated. <i>Note: It is my speculation that Lanfear was somehow weakened in the One Power after leaving the land of the Eelfinn. When <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> went there, his last wish was to get out of there; if hers was not, she may have died there, and they took both her life and some of her strength from her as a price.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a>.
