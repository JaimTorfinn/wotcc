The Daughter-Heir is traditionally sent to Tar Valon to receive training from the Aes Sedai, although until the previous Daughter-Heir, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, most have been too weak to get beyond novice training. Now that Elayne is Queen, there <i>is</i> no Daughter-Heir in Andor. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n"
