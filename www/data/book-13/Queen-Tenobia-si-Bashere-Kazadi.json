She is tall for a woman, with an overbold nose like an eagle&apos;s beak, a wide mouth, and dark, deep, blue, slanted, almost purple eyes. She is quite pretty. She is the niece of her Marshal-General, <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>. She is currently in Far Madding with the rest of the rulers of the Borderlands, and has not yet forgiven her uncle for deserting her and following <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>. She is young, impertinant, and reckless; a wildfire in the wind. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Bashere'>Bashere, Davram t&apos;Ghaline</a>; <a href='#Torkumen'>Torkumen, Vram</a>. "
