In gratitude, she named him Captain of the Queen&apos;s Bodyguard. He is a Darkfriend, and works for <a href='#Shiaine'>Shiaine</a>. He is not bulky, and little taller than the average run of men. He feigned a relationship with <a href='#Falion'>Falion Bhoda</a> so that the two could exchange information discreetly. He was arrested by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> when she discovered evidence that he was visiting Black sisters. He later escaped, with Darkfriend assistance, from the dungeons under the Palace. He promises that he will hunt down <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and rape and kill her himself. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Hanlon'>Hanlon, Daved</a>; <a href='#Mellar'>Mellar, Doilin</a>. "
