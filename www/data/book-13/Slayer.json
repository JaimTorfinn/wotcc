{"id":"Slayer","name":"Slayer","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 24: To Make a Stand","info":"<a class='name' name='Slayer'>Slayer</a>, p. 395&#x2014;Man who appears, in the flesh, to <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> and the wolves in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. He is described by those who serve the Shadow and know what he is as, &#x201C;the man with two souls.&#x201D; <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> once hunted him, chasing him through <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> all the way to the Tower of Ghenjei. He has not seen much of him since, though Slayer has been busy again in recent weeks: he enjoys killing wolves, considering them good sport. The Shadow uses his ability to enter and leave the World of Dreams at will to assassinate people thought important to the Light&apos;s cause. He once tried to kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Min'>Min</a> in their sleep, though he had the wrong room. Slayer is <a href='#Isam'>Isam</a>, <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s cousin, and his other soul is <a href='#Luc'>Luc</a>, whose form he seems to prefer in the real world. Luc is Rand&apos;s uncle, which Luc is aware of but Rand is not. The wolves describe his scent as &#x201C;inhuman,&#x201D; like a man mixed with stone. Slayer, in Isam&apos;s form, is muscular and tanned, with thick arms, dark hair, and blue eyes. He closely resembles Lan, his face all angles and sharp lines. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Chiendelna'>Chiendelna, Luc</a>; <a href='#Luc'>Mantear, Luc</a>. "}]}
