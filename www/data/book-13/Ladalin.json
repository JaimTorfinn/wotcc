She cannot channel, though she very much wishes she could. War with the Seanchan is all she has <i>ever</i> known. She remembers the strikes on Almoth Plain. She spent her youth training, then fighting battles in Tear. She and Mora are the only remaining Wise Ones who, along with the three remaining clan chiefs, are all that is left of the Council of 22. She has a son. She is of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>&apos;s line, one of the last living. All of his other descendants have died (in her timeline, at least). <i>See also</i> <a href='#Takai'>Takai</a>; <a href='#Tamaar'>Tamaar</a>. "
