She has a vulpine face and golden hair in a bun. Her husband <a href='#Jarid'>Jarid</a> opposed <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> during the Succession. <a href='#Dyelin'>Dyelin</a> exiled her from Caemlyn, as Morgase did long ago, for attempting to take the Lion Throne. She still planned to take it from <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, though once she was rescued from Aringill by <a href='#Arymilla'>Arymilla</a>&apos;s men, her claim vanished. Her House later supported Arymilla for the Lion Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor. However, she thinks Arymilla &#x201C;lacks the wit&#x201D; to be queen, and Elayne too immature&#x2014;she is also not above causing &#x201C;accidents&#x201D; for her rivals. Elayne imprisoned her after Arymilla&apos;s failed attempt to take the Throne. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Naean'>Arawn, Naean</a>; <a href='#Arymilla'>Marne, Arymilla</a>. "
