He has been caught by the Queen&apos;s Guards only because another ruffian ratted him out. The only way to be so successful a catpurse is to not be seen by those you stalk, so <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> used him to tail <a href='#Mellar'>Doilin Mellar</a> at night to see where he went. He found Mellar was in league with known Darkfriends, so Elayne had him arrested. Hark is still used as a spy in Andor. "
