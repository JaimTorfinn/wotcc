She was weary-eyed and resigned the first day <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a> met her, when she gave Faile her golden belt signifying service to <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>. Her time as <i>gai&apos;shain</i> toughened her a lot. She was the one who took Faile to see that <a href='#Arrela'>Arrela</a> and <a href='#Lacile'>Lacile</a> had been captured, then led her to Sevanna for her own punishment. Before leaving her with Sevanna, however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile&apos;s new last name. She knew Faile planned to escape, and wanted to help&#x2014;provided she could escape as well. She was once a noble, it appears. She grew up in Amadicia. Her face is plump, but still haggard from her captivity. She acts as the unofficial Steward of <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> and Faile&apos;s camp. "
