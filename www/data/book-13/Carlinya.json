She had no Warders, which is not unusual for a White sister, though she had been studying men from within her cowl as if to find one among the soldiers in Bryne&apos;s army. She had short, dark, curly hair, and was seldom emotional (which is also common for Whites). She died in the attacks by the Black Ajah in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. "}]}
