The Nae&apos;blis has been chosen: <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a>, the reincarnation of <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. Other Forsaken realize that this appointment only lasts as long as the Dark One is pleased with Moridin and Moridin remains alive, however. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>; <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a>.
