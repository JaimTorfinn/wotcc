            "info": "<a class='name' name='Emarin2'>Emarin</a>, p. 684&#x2014;Soldier in the Black Tower. He is old, with thin hair and wrinkled eyes. He has a short white beard that he keeps trimmed to a point. He is an enigma; he arrived one day with <a href='#Logain'>Logain</a>, saying nothing of his past. He is distinguished, with a poised bearing and a delicate way of speaking. He is almost certainly nobly born. He makes no attempt to assert his presumed authority. He took to life in the Black Tower immediately. <i>Editor&apos;s note: There is a distinct possibility that this Emarin and Emarin Pendaloan, Algarin&apos;s younger brother, are the same person. That Emarin was captured by <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a> and gentled, though he survived for at least ten years afterward. Algarin seemed to think that Emarin was dead, however.</i> "
