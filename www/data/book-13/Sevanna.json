            "info": "<a class='name' name='Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>, p. 122&#x2014;Wise One of the Jumai sept of the Shaido Aiel. She is the widow of the last two chiefs of the Shaido, Suladric and <a href='#Couladin'>Couladin</a>, and served as chief of the Shaido since Couladin&apos;s death. Everyone seemed to know that she had no intention of letting another prospective chief be sent to Rhuidean. She has green eyes. She knows that the easiest way to power for herself is to attach herself to men who already hold power; she even envisioned marrying <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> (against his will) to gain power through him. She led her clan (and any Aiel deserters that joined her) through Ghealdan, where they were sent from Kinslayer&apos;s Dagger by Sammael. She constantly wanted more <i>gai&apos;shain</i>&#x2014;her goal was to indenture the entire world. She had taken a fancy to wearing silk, and wore nothing else. She is tall, has pale green eyes, and hair like spun gold. She would be beautiful except for the strong hint of avarice around her plump mouth. Little about her seemed Aiel beyond her eyes, skin, and hair. She also wore rings on every finger, and non-Aiel-made jewelry everwhere else. All of these were seized when she was captured by <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> and his Seanchan allies. Her clan now stands in ruin, with no one to blame but herself. Sevanna is known to have been the only person to be almost refused her eventual status as a Wise One; part of their training is that they must declare that they are no longer students, and Sevanna declared herself to be done with her training after it had barely begun.
