She was stilled by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> during the battle at Dumai&apos;s Wells. She has since been Healed by <a href='#Flinn'>Damer Flinn</a>, and is now an apprentice of the Wise Ones and oathsworn to Rand. She even wears Aiel jewelry, and has since taken charge of the previously stilled sisters in Cairhien. She has curly hair and a face that does not seem like that of an Aes Sedai. She and <a href='#Samitsu'>Samitsu</a> are the closest things Cairhien has to rulers in <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s absence. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Samitsu'>Tamagowa, Samitsu</a>. "
