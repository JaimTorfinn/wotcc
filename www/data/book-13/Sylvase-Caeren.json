She is sturdy, of medium build, placid, unemotional, and quite pretty except for the expressionless look. She appears to have a cow&apos;s wits to accompany her cow-like expression. Actually, she rarely speaks. Her blue eyes appear vapid. Despite her appearances to the contrary, she is <i>quite</i> cunning; she buries it deeply. "
