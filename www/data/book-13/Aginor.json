            "info": "<a class='name' name='Aginor'>Aginor</a>, p. 28&#x2014;One of the Forsaken. During the Age of Legends, he was one of the foremost biologists of his time, specializing in genetics. He went over to the Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments he wanted to. He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar, <i>gholam</i>, Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn. Some of the other Forsaken think he was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures he did. He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the Bore, after Balthamel. He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore. He was killed by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> at the Eye of the World. Unbeknownst to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name Osan&apos;gar. Osan&apos;gar masqueraded as Corlan Dashiva, one of the Asha&apos;man, until he was killed at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i> by Elza Penfell and her circle. One of Aginor&apos;s creations was the <i>zomara</i>, androgynous not-quite-human servants; they are almost useless for any other task. <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a> describes them as one of Aginor&apos;s &#x201C;less inspired creations.&#x201D; "
