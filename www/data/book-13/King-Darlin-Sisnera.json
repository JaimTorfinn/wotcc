He was considering <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>&apos;s offer of support if he declared himself king of Tear, until he was made the Steward for the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> in Tear. Rand figures that this will keep the nobles scheming among themselves so much that they will not have time to make trouble for him. Rand later made Darlin the first King of Tear in memory. He has a prominent nose, and is about a head shorter than Rand. He has a short black beard, and close-cropped hair. "}]}
