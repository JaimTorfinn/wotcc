He is quite ugly&#x2014;one eye, several teeth missing, and nearly bald. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> thinks he may be the ugliest man he has ever seen. He is friends with <a href='#Trahelion'>Birgitte</a>. She says that if he were younger and had his nose broken a few times, she might actually be interested in him. He has a big chest, with some wisps of curly hair on his head. He makes what Mat describes as &#x201C;ugly&#x201D; beer. "
