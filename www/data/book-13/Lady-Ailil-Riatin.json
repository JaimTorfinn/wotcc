She is Toram Riatin&apos;s sister, and would have done anything for him if he asked her to. She is also the daughter of King Galldrian. She is tall for a Cairhienin woman (and <i>only</i> for a Cairhienin woman&amp;hellp;). She had pledged for <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, but disappeared after the attack by Asha&apos;man. The last Rand saw her, she was bound with the Power under a bed. Since Toram is assumed dead, she has assumed the High Seat of House Riatin. She is slim and middle-aged, and a vocal supporter of <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. "
