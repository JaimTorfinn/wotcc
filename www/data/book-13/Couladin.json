He never went to Rhuidean, but declared himself the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i> after <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a> placed two dragons on his arms in a copy of those on <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s arms. When the rest of the Aiel chiefs declared for Rand, Couladin took the Shaido west across the Spine of the World to ravage Cairhien. Although almost every other clan despises the Shaido, all agree that even they deserved a real chief&#x2014;they never got one. Couladin died outside Cairhien while fighting <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>&#x2014;Mat killed him, but later remarked that Couladin had to have been born with a spear in his hands to be that good. Mat later described the encounter by saying, &#x201C;One of us had to die. It wasn&apos;t bloody well going to be me.&#x201D; After his death, the remnants of Couladin&apos;s clan fled to Kinslayer&apos;s Dagger under the command of his widow, <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>. His head was placed on a pike while Mat&apos;s troops danced around it and the rest of the Aiel spit on it. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>. "
