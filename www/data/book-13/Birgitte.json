She has long blonde hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the best with bow and arrows in all human history. During <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was ripped out of <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> and almost died. She would have if she had not been saved by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, who bonded her as a Warder to give her the strength and quick healing she needed to survive. She is always linked to <a href='#Gaidal'>Gaidal Cain</a> in the stories, and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was ripped out. She lived four lives between the founding of the White Tower and the Trolloc Wars, one of which involved her and Gaidal Cain <i>helping</i> to found the Tower. She is slowly forgetting the details of those lives, which terrifies her. She has lived as a soldier, a forest woman, a general, a guard, a noble thief, a lady, a peasant, a killer, and a savior. This is, however, the first time she has been a Warder. She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed to be like, except that she <i>is</i> pretty. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Gaidal'>Cain, Gaidal</a>; <a href='#Maerion'>Maerion</a>; <a href='#Jethari'>Moondancer, Jethari</a>; <a href='#Trahelion'>Trahelion, Birgitte</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
