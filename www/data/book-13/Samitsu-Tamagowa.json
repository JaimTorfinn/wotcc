She was the Aes Sedai left in charge of Cairhien when <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a> left prior to the cleansing of <i>saidin</i>, and is now with the entourage of sisters that obey Cadsuane and protect <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>. She tried to Heal Rand&apos;s side wound and mostly failed, but when <a href='#Flinn'>Damer Flinn</a> was able to partially Heal him using a more sophisticated weave, she begged on her knees for him to teach her. She is pretty, slender, has hazel eyes, and dark hair that she keeps bells in. She grew up in Arafel. She and <a href='#Sashalle'>Sashalle</a> are the closest things Cairhien has to rulers in <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s absence. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Sashalle'>Anderly, Sashalle</a>; <a href='#Flinn'>Flinn, Damer</a>.
