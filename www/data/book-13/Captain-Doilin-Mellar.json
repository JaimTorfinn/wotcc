            "info": "<a class='name' name='Mellar'>Captain Doilin Mellar</a>, p. 373&#x2014;Guard who slew <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>&apos;s assassins. He cut the first&apos;s head off, <i>threw</i> his sword at the second and speared him with it, and took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it. He is wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot. He is fond of teasing women. He claims to have been a merchant&apos;s guard, then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn. He is now a lieutenant in the Queen&apos;s Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her bodyguard. He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or handsome. He moves with a swordsman&apos;s grace, and is very strong. Mellar claims to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claims to have fought on <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>&apos;s side during the Succession. Half the palace has accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne&apos;s twins, though he himself may be unaware that this rumor exists. Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else, he also answers to the name <a href='#Hanlon'>Daved Hanlon</a>, a Darkfriend. To him, a name is akin to a coat&#x2014;to be changed regularly and to suit the conditions. Elayne grew more than suspicious of his loyalties, and eventually had <a href='#Hark'>Hark</a> follow him to see who he was meeting. It was the Black sisters; Elayne arrested him immediately. He was broken out recently; in the subsequent fight with Elayne, he killed <a href='#Eldrith'>Eldrith</a> and <a href='#Temaile'>Temaile</a> rather than let them slow him down. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Hanlon'>Hanlon, Daved</a>.
