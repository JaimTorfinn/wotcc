His <i>con</i> is three yellow stars on a blue field. His banner is a black fox. He rarely smiles, and reminds Mat of a compressed spring. He commands about half of Mat&apos;s cavalry in the Band of the Red Hand, and acts as the leader of the entire Band in Mat&apos;s absence. He is skinny, and has gray hair. He has no fashion sense, but has excellent taste in wine. "}]}
