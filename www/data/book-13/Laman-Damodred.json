            "info": "<a class='name' name='Laman'>Laman Damodred</a>, p. 762&#x2014;King of Cairhien about twenty years ago. His cutting of <i><a href='#Avendo'>Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War. The war continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed Laman and took his sword. Because of Laman&apos;s Pride, and his Sin, House Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never again reached any of its former glory&#x2014;but it also allowed Prophecy to be fulfilled; the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> was able to be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the Spear but raised by the blood of the old nations. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>.
