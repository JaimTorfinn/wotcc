His ship was captured by <a href='#Tamarath'>Egeanin</a> at Falme, and she was afraid Domon would recognize her the next time they met. She was right&#x2014;he did. He became one of Egeanin&apos;s <i>so&apos;jhin</i>. When Egeanin captured his ship, he was trying to drop the male <i>a&apos;dam</i> in the ocean. The two are now involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay together), which no one else seems to understand&#x2014;anyone who talks to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along with. He is now <a href='#Leilwin2'>Leilwin</a>&apos;s husband and <i>so&apos;jhin</i>. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> describes him as &#x201C;not to bad a guy&#x201D; except when he is around Leilwin. Since he is always around her, Mat considers him unmanageable. He remembers where the Tower of Ghenjei is. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Leilwin2'>Shipless, Leilwin</a>; <a href='#Tamarath'>Tamarath, Egeanin</a>. "}]}
