{"id":"Kaisea","name":"Kaisea","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 33: A Good Soup","info":"<a class='name' name='Kaisea'>Kaisea</a>, p. 523&#x2014;Former <i>sul&apos;dam</i> and member of the Low Blood, now captured by the Asha&apos;man and held prisoner in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn. She is tall, and has long black hair in a braid. She has been convinced that she can learn to channel, and now asserts that she must be collared. The Aes Sedai working with her think she is determined to learn the weaves only so she can do something dangerous, thus providing evidence that she <i>needs</i> to be collared. They keep some forkroot in her at all times these days, just to be sure. She claims that it is <i>impossible</i> that <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> took the bloodknife off of a living Bloodknife; she reasons that if he fought a Bloodknife, he would be dead. Her knowledge of them convinces Gawyn that the Tower is in danger from the remaining Seanchan assassins. "}]}
