He was torn limb from limb, presumably by a <i>gholam</i> or by <a href='#Slayer'>Slayer</a>, for unknown reasons, although it is likely that he had stumbled upon something quite damaging to the cause of the Shadow if they were that desperate to do him in. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> read his book, <i>Reason and Unreason</i>, in an attempt to understand better why he was murdered; she is now making her way through the rest of his collection. Rand cannot make up from down in Fel&apos;s books, but Min finds them fascinating. "
