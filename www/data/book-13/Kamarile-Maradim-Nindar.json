            "info": "<a class='name' name='Kamarile'>Kamarile Maradim Nindar</a>, p. 852&#x2014;Noted ascetic and Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. She was also an expert in psychiatric disorders, perhaps the best ever to live. Eventually she realized the world could never live up to her standards, so she became everything she once loathed. She started wearing suggestive, revealing clothing and living frivolously and lavishly. She turned to the Shadow, and became <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>. She was the second of the Forsaken, after <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. Her plans have led to the death of three of the Chosen: <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a>, whom she shielded and bound in <a href='#Natrin'>Natrin</a>&apos;s Barrow so she would die by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s balefire; <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a>, whom she killed herself, and <a href='#Mesaana'>Mesaana</a>, who was trapped in the White Tower because of Graendal&apos;s Dreamspike and could not flee to a safe area in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> during the fight with <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> and the Aes Sedai.
