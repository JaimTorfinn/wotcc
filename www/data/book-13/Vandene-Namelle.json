Their goal was some day to write the complete history of the World since the Breaking, and some even before that. They were both summoned back early, however, and they later came to Salidar to escape <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>&apos;s summons back to the Tower. Vandene went with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> to Caemlyn, and dedicated nearly all of her waking hours to tracking down Adeleas&apos;s murderess. She found her when she, Elayne, <a href='#Sareitha'>Sareitha</a>, and <a href='#Careane'>Careane</a> were captured by the Black Ajah: Careane was named &#x201C;one of us&#x201D; by one of the Black sisters. Vandene immediately plunged her dagger into Careane&apos;s heart, but did not survive her long: <a href='#Chesmal'>Chesmal</a> touched her and Sareitha with a weave Elayne had never seen before, and they both collapsed as if made of cloth. She was slender, and had white hair. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Adeleas'>Namelle, Adeleas</a>. "}]}
