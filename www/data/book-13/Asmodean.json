He was born Joar Addam Nessosin, a child prodigy in music and art, in the then coastal city of Shorelle. He gave his life to the Shadow in exchange for the immortality he received, so he could study and perfect his music. After being released from the Bore, he was coerced by <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a> into coming with her, eventually to teach <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> to channel without killing himself. Asmodean was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of <i>angreal</i>, <i>ter&apos;angreal</i>, and most especially the two white statue <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that linked the holder to the great <i>sa&apos;angreal</i> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together could Break the World beyond repair. He went there to obtain the male statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>. He then became Rand&apos;s teacher, and went into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if they saw him. He was killed by <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a> right after <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> and Lanfear were killed/trapped. "
