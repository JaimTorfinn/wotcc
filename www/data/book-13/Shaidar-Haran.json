{"id":"Shaidar-Haran","name":"Shaidar Haran","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 5: Writings","info":"<a class='name' name='Shaidar'>Shaidar Haran</a>, p. 117&#x2014;A Myrddraal of special abilities who escorts the Chosen (i.e., Forsaken) to the Pit of Doom to converse with the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>. He is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the height of an average man and all the same height. His name means &#x201C;Hand of the Dark&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names come from the Trolloc tongue. He is given special consideration; the ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it does everyone else&apos;s. He is the only known servant of the Dark One to have power over the Chosen (other than <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a>, who is one of the Chosen himself). It was Shaidar Haran himself who freed <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage</a> from her captivity; he may have set Semirhage up to be killed because the Dark One (or perhaps Moridin) was displeased with her.
