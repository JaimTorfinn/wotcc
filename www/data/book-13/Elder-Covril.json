She came to Caemlyn searching for her son <a href='#Loial'>Loial</a>, and went with Haman and Erith to the Two Rivers to find him. She finally caught up with him, with Haman and Erith in tow, and now Loial is married. She originally spoke out against him speaking at the Stump, claiming he was far too young and inexperienced. She later changed her mind, becoming his most vocal advocate and eventually convincing the other Elders to allow Loial to address the Stump. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Loial'>Loial</a>. "
