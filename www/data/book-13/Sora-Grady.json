She disapproved of her husband&apos;s decision to come for the amnesty, but lives with it. She is somehow connected to Jur by a bond that the Asha&apos;man believe is similar to the bond between Warder and Aes Sedai. She accepted Jur&apos;s decision to become an Asha&apos;man because they thought he had little choice&#x2014;his father could channel, and the Red Ajah found him shortly after Jur was born. He did not live long after they gentled him. Now that the taint is gone, he is anxious to tell Sora that they can continue to live out their lives without fear that he will go insane. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Gadren'>Grady, Gadren</a>; <a href='#Grady'>Grady, Jur</a>.
