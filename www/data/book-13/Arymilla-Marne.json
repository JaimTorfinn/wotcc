            "info": "<a class='name' name='Arymilla'>Arymilla Marne</a>, p. 728&#x2014;Brown-eyed Andoran noble with a habit of fainting. She opposed <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> during the Succession. The only real reason <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> kept her around in Caemlyn was to push others into supporting <a href='#Dyelin'>Dyelin</a>; no one wanted Andor in the hands of Arymilla. Once <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> returned to Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had. However, Arymilla learned of where <a href='#Naean'>Naean</a> and <a href='#Elenia'>Elenia</a> were being detained in Murandy and rescued them. This debt of sorts bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support Arymilla&apos;s claim to the Lion Throne. She had the support of five major houses of Andor at one point. She is plump, verging on stout, has a vacuous smile, and brown eyes that are almost always wide with interest. After her failed attempt to take the Throne, Elayne had her imprisoned; she is still plump despite her captivity. She might even be pretty if not for the rags she now wears. Her sign is four silver moons on a twilight blue field. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Naean'>Arawn, Naean</a>; <a href='#Elenia'>Sarand, Elenia</a>. "
