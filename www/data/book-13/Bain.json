She is first-sister to <a href='#Chiad'>Chiad</a>, of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak through the camp of the other to find the Wise Ones to become first sisters, since their clans were in blood feud at the time. She later became one of the Maidens who accompanied <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>, a similar honor guard to what <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> has, although smaller and for different reasons. She and Chiad were both captured by the Shaido along with the rest of Faile&apos;s company, and made <i>gai&apos;shain</i>. She has refused Faile&apos;s offer of escape once her plan is ready; she vows to serve her year and a day, as prescribed by <i>ji&apos;e&apos;toh</i>, and then walk away. She and Chiad are now <i>gai&apos;shain</i> to <a href='#Gaul'>Gaul</a>; Gaul groaned when he found that Bain was <i>gai&apos;shain</i> to one of the men he had to kill to save Chiad. She and Chiad have been having fun at Gaul&apos;s expense in their service to him. Gaul suspects <a href='#Dark'>Sightblinder</a> would be a less infuriating <i>gai&apos;shain</i>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Chiad'>Chiad</a>; <a href='#Gaul'>Gaul</a>. "
