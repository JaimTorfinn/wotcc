Once the Tower was reunited, there was talk that Gareth Bryne would take his place as High Captain of the Tower Guard. However, Bryne was not interested in the post, and <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> advised <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> not to make a change, as it might sow resentment in the Guards. She left Chubain in place, though he still seems to be protective of his job. He looks younger than he his, which is in his forties. His hair is all black, without a touch of gray. "
