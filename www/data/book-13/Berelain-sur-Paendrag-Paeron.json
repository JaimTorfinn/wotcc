She is fond of wearing the latest fashion in dresses, and those are usually quite revealing. She has her eyes on many men, but <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> foremost&#x2014;she is <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s hawk in her viewings of Perrin. She has black hair. She is a very capable ruler, willing to do almost anything to preserve the welfare and independence of her people. She is tall, pretty, young, and has black hair. Since Faile&apos;s captivity, she has backed off of Perrin, though rumors have been circulating that the she and Perrin slept together. They did not, of course; Perrin was simply taken into her tent until he recovered from illness. She and Faile are working things out between themselves, attempting to defuse the rumors. Berelain is willing to do almost <i>anything</i> to ensure that Mayene is preserved and not merely annexed by another larger country. She is one of the most skillful political maneuverers that Faile has <i>ever</i> met. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Faile'>t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>; <a href='#Gallenne'>Gallenne, Bertain</a>; <a href='#Annoura'>Larisen, Annoura</a>.
