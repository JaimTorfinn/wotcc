He is a buffoon; he remarked to other Domani nobles that he could manipulate the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> however he wished. <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> used him as bait for <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>; she ordered <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a> and <a href='#Delana'>Delana</a> to lay Compulsion weaves on him, and then sent him back to Rand. Ramshalan thinks he will be chosen King of Arad Doman by gaining Rand&apos;s confidence&#x2014;and he is enough of a buffoon to actually believe he is succeeding. "
