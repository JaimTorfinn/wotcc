He pretended to be fixing his cart while Holdwin was talking to a Fade, and later found he was looking for <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> during their trip through Andor right after leaving Emond&apos;s Field. He later offered the two a ride, since he does not like Holdwin that much and would rather help the boys than the Darkfriend. His sister owns an orchard. He is loyal to the Queen. He is missing many teeth. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Adim'>Adim</a>; <a href='#Adrinne'>Bunt, Adrinne</a>; <a href='#Hahn'>Hahn</a>. "
