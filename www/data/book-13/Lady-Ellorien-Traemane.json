{"id":"Lady-Ellorien-Traemane","name":"Lady Ellorien Traemane","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 6: Questioning Intentions","info":"<a class='name' name='Ellorien'>Lady Ellorien Traemane</a>, p. 122&#x2014;Andoran lady, leader of a strong House that supported <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> during the Succession, and one of Morgase&apos;s best friends. Morgase exiled her from Caemlyn as per <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>&apos;s suggestion; when Ellorien demanded to know why, Morgase had her flogged. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> was named after her grandmother. Morgase hopes she will forgive her for what she did and support her when she comes to Andor to reclaim her throne, or at least support <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> in her claim. She and her House have effectively disappeared from the face of Andoran politics for the last few weeks. Morgase remembers exiling her, but she does not remember <i>why</i> she exiled her. She has been the most problematic holdout against Elayne, except perhaps for <a href='#Jarid'>Jarid Sarand</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>; <a href='#Jarid'>Sarand, Jarid</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
