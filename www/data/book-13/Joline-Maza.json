She was a Sitter for the Green, appointed after one of the Green&apos;s sitters left for Salidar. <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> asked her to resign her position after only weeks and sent her to Ebou Dar to meet with <a href='#Tylin'>Queen Tylin</a> of Altara. She has two Warders named <a href='#Blaeric'>Blaeric</a> and <a href='#Fen'>Fen</a>. One might think Joline has a wish to become a <i>damane</i>; she is <i>very</i> careless around the Seanchan. She is slender and pretty, and has big brown eyes. She is everything <a href='#Teslyn'>Teslyn</a> is not. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> thinks she would never be taken for someone he liked; he would be unwilling even to wish her on one of his enemies. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Fen'>Mizar, Fen</a>; <a href='#Blaeric'>Negina, Blaeric</a>.
