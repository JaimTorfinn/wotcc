            "info": "<a class='name' name='Doesine'>Doesine Alwain</a>, p. 226&#x2014;Sitter for the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon. Boyishly slim, and tall for a Cairhienin. Her father was a cutler. She ran away three times as a novice, although she only got as far as the gates once. She has a bit of a foul tongue. She managed to get Atuan questioned in the same manner Talene was. She and <a href='#Saerin'>Saerin</a> walked in on <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine</a> and <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> when they were using the Oath Rod to question sisters; she promptly booted Seaine out of the leadership and seized the reins herself. She has blue eyes and wears a sapphire on her forehead in the Cairhienin style. She and Seaine were charged with determining whether it was possible to fool or circumvent the Oath Rod; they discovered an alteration to the Mask of Mirrors that would allow the user to distort the <i>words</i> they were saying, so that they could in fact say anything at all (with approximately the same length sentences, at least) and have everyone else hear something else.
