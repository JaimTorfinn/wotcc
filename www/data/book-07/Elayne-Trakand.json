{"id":"Elayne-Trakand","name":"Elayne Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue: Lightnings","info":"<a class='name' name='Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, p. 18 (8)&#x2014;The Daughter-Heir of Andor, now an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. She is the daughter of <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> and her late husband, Taringail, and sister to <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>. She is also half-sister to <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>, although she would rather not be reminded of this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and doesn&apos;t really like him. She has considerable potential in the One Power, and is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more, possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exception of <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. She has red-gold curly hair. During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne realized she loved <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and told him how she felt; he felt similarly. She had no idea at the time what <a href='#Min'>Min</a> meant about &quot;having to share him,&quot; but now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads, indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>, and they with him. Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only Accepted) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life. Elayne is currently in Ebou Dar, looking for the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that she believes will fix the weather. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>; <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
