She was friends with <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine</a> as a novice; the two maintained the friendship, although it was a bit restrained due to the constraints that the Red Ajah puts on its members about making friends outside the Ajah. She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump. She has dark eyes. She was once punished for voicing her desire to have a Warder; later, as a Sitter, when she was safer from the wrath of the Ajah, she openly suggested that Warders would make the job of a Red sister much easier. Seaine thinks she would have been happier as a Green. When she was small, many members of her family were killed by Darkfriends; it is for this reason that Seaine confides in her about searching for Darkfriends in the White Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Seaine'>Herimon, Seaine</a>.
