            "info": "<a class='name' name='Logain'>Lord Logain Ablar</a>, p. 18 (8)&#x2014;False <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon</a> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah. He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions. Before he was gentled he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great power sometime in the future. Recently, Logain has come forward with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up to declaring himself the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more glory than gentling a simple man who could channel. Logain was recently Healed by <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, and was let free by <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> to do as he pleased; it is assumed that he is on his way to the Black Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.
