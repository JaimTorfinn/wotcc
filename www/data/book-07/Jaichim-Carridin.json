Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend. He was given orders (under the name <a href='#Bors'>Bors</a>) by <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a> to find and kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead. So far, Carridin has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest sister Dealda (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade). His sister, <a href='#Vanora'>Vanora</a>, recently met with a similar fate. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Shiaine'>Avarhin, Shiaine</a>; <a href='#Bors'>Bors</a>; <a href='#Vanora'>Carridin, Vanora</a>.
