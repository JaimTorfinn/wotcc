She has light hair and a face like a doll. She grew up in Tarabon. She led the group of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process. Liandrin was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came to the Tower), so it can&apos;t really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at all.
