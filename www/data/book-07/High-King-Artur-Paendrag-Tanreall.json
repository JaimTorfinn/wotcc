            "info": "<a class='name' name='Artur'>High King Artur Paendrag Tanreall</a>, p. 431 (552)&#x2014;Hero of Legend who conquered much of the known world about a thousand years ago. He was perhaps the most strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> individual in recorded history besides <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> and <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>. His armies put down those of <a href='#Guaire'>Guaire Amalasan</a>, a false <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon</a>. He was given the name Hawkwing during this period, a designation based on his sigil. He later sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin, in hopes of conquering new lands there. All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing&apos;s death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing&apos;s empire in the Old World&#x2014;they now call themselves the Seanchan. His sign was a golden hawk in flight. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Guaire'>Amalasan, Guaire</a>; <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. "
