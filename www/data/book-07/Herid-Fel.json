He studies history and philosophy, and was one of <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s friends. His last communication was that he needed to tell Rand something; the next anyone saw him, he was torn apart limb from limb by a <i>gholam</i>, or possibly Slayer. It is unknown why Fel was killed or what he had conjured up that would frighten the Shadow enough to send a <i>gholam</i> or Slayer after him. <i>Note: there is a debate going on among fans of the series as to exactly what Fel had discovered that was so important.

Perhaps we will never know for sure.</i> "
