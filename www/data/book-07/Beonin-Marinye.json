Her blue-gray eyes seem to constantly look startled. Nothing seems to surprise her, though, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> thinks she would not believe the sun would come up unless she saw it herself, and if one morning it did not, she would just take it to confirm that she was correct to demand proof. She is one of the six sisters in Salidar that have most of the authority, despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower. "
