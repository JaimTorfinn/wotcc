{"id":"Loial","name":"Loial","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1: High Chasaline","info":"<a class='name' name='Loial'>Loial</a>, p. 67 (73)&#x2014;Son of Arent son of Halan, an Ogier from Stedding Shangtai. He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders. He is fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger. He is writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>. Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to marry him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother&apos;s choice of wives for him, <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>. He, like most of the Ogier, is sad that most humans don&apos;t remember the Ogier, and is horrified that some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>; <a href='#Karldin'>Manfor, Karldin</a>.
