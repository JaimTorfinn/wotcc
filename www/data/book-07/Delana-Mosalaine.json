She is the only Sitter that <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> thinks she can count on. She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman. She is from Shienar. Known to few, she is actually of the Black Ajah; Egwene might be more than a little worried that the only Sitter that does as she asks is Black Ajah. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Halima'>Saranov, Halima</a>.
