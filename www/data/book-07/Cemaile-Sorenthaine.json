She was raised about three hundred years ago. In memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler held a throne without the White Tower&apos;s approval, she had a gilded clock commissioned. The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after she died, and it did not reappear until <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> put it back up when she was raised. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>.
