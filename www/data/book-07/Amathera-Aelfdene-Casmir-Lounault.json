            "info": "<a class='name' name='Amathera'>Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</a>, p. 433 (555)&#x2014;Former Panarch of Tarabon. She vanished, allegedly at Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies. In reality, Amathera was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>, and was rescued by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>. They had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the mob outside the Panarch&apos;s Palace (since it is not all that far from &#x201C;The Panarch is dead!&#x201D; to &#x201C;Death to the Panarch!&#x201D;), then she returned to her position. When the Seanchan invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant. She now serves as a dancer for <a href='#Suroth'>High Lady Suroth</a>, the leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Thera'>Thera</a>. "
