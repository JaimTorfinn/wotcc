An alternative name would be God. After He created the world, the Creator made a prison for <a href='#Dark'>Shai&apos;tan</a>, the Dark One, His complete opposite in every way, to keep him from influencing the world. The Creator is bent on non-interference&#x2014;He will not directly influence events in the world, instead using a &#x201C;Chosen One&#x201D; or simply tugging at the Pattern of the Age in hopes that what He wants to occur will occur, instead of just making it happen. The Forsaken and most Darkfriends consider Him to be inferior to the Dark One, despite the fact that He imprisoned him. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>.
