            "info": "<a class='name' name='Lan'>al&apos;Lan Mandragoran</a>, p. 233 (289)&#x2014;The uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>. He is quite tall, and doesn&apos;t get very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan&apos;s status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan&apos;s favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but don&apos;t grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for her. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Myrelle'>Berengari, Myrelle</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>.
