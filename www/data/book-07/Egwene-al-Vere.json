            "info": "<a class='name' name='Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, p. 23 (15)&#x2014;A young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>. She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and don&apos;t really want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Marin'>al&apos;Vere, Marin</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
