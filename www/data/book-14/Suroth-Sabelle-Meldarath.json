This is the typical Seanchan style for those &#x201C;of the Blood.&#x201D; Suroth was determined to redeem herself after High Lord Turak&apos;s mishap at Falme&#x2014;she did not want to have to explain a failure that was not hers to the <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>. She gathered all of the Seanchan ships that fled Falme so they would not go back home; she then retook portions of the mainland again, but was prevented from taking Illian by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and his Asha&apos;man. Egeanin delivered the Domination Band to Suroth herself, not knowing Suroth&apos;s true loyalties; known to few until the moment of her capture, Suroth was Atha&apos;an Shadar, &#x201C;Those Bound to Shadow&#x201D; (a Darkfriend), and was high in their ranks.
