            "info": "<a class='name' name='Darlin'>King Darlin Sisnera</a>, p. 152&#x2014;Former High Lord of Tear, one of those who went into hiding in Haddon Mirk once the battle at Cairhien was over. <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> says he almost admired him&#x2014;he opposed Rand from the very start, fleeing the Stone of Tear when it fell and trying to rouse resistance among the rural nobles. He was considering <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>&apos;s offer of support if he declared himself king of Tear, until he was made the Steward for the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> in Tear. Rand figures that this would keep the nobles scheming among themselves so much that they would not have time to make trouble for him. Rand later made Darlin the first King of Tear in memory. He has a prominent nose, and is about a head shorter than Rand. He has a short black beard, and close-cropped hair. Despite Rand&apos;s responsibility for his position in Tear, Darlin supports <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> in her position regarding the seals. He is second in command to Ituralde in battle. "
