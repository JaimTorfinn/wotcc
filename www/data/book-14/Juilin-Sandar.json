He accompanied <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> on their travels because <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a> asked him to. He accepted partly out of respect for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when Liandrin used Compulsion on him, and later realized how wrong it was. He carries a notched sword-breaker and a staff with which he is deadly; he could make a Whitecloak appear relaxed. He has fallen in love with <a href='#Amathera'>Amathera</a>, the Panarch of Tarabon. He traveled with <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a> for a time, and is now the leader of a squad tasked with protecting the Aes Sedai from the Sharan infantry. He has no idea how he came to command troops, or why anyone would trust him to do so. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amathera'>Lounault, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir</a>. "}]}
