She has thin, white hair; tight, leathery skin; and green eyes. She can channel, but only weakly. She is about a head taller than <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. She is the strongest-willed of the Wise Ones&#x2014;even other Wise Ones scurry to do her bidding, and <i>no one</i> gives her orders. <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a> invited her to help interrogate <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage</a>; she is the only person Cadsuane has met in recent memory that she would consider her equal. She and Cadsuane shared a goal: to make sure <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> still knew the feeling of laughter and sadness, that he still had compassion within him. "
