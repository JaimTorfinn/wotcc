She carries a dignified air about her. She was a Sitter in the White Tower for forty years until <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> was deposed. She is quite old. She led one of the two factions that divided the Hall of the Tower under <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. Lelaine had a <i>strong</i> desire to hold the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> herself, enough that once that Egwene was captured she nearly tried to seize it. She took to feigning support for Egwene to establish power in the Hall, anticipating that Egwene would not return. She is capable, strong-willed, and decisive. She is not beautiful, but she <i>is</i> pretty, particularly when she smiles. She is slender and graceful, with no gray in her dark hair. Her face is almond-shaped, with full lips. She represented the Blue Ajah at <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s test for the shawl. "}]}
