His face is filled with sharp lines. He has a cleft chin, a hooked, once-broken nose, and jutting cheek bones. He is a Blademaster. Shadows cover his eyes. He was one of two Warders who was with the eleven Aes Sedai that escaped Dumai&apos;s Wells, though Sleete barely escaped with his skin. His story could have been drawn from legends: he had lain wounded for hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins; the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a group of bandits. The mayor&apos;s daughter argued for his life, convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders. The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health. He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they would never trouble the village again. Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete believed the person to be worthy. He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered <a href='#Lan'>Lan Mandragoran</a>, back when Lan still practiced with the other Warders. Sleete beat Lan in two of their seven duels, and Lan is widely considered the best Warder and Blademaster in the world. However, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> beats Sleete in every duel, even when Sleete has a capable partner. Sleete asked Gawyn if he would be interested in being Hattori&apos;s second Warder; Gawyn politely declined. Sleete now lends his services to <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>&apos;s army and the rest of the sisters, having been reunited with Hattori. "}]}
