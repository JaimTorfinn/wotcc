            "info": "<a class='name' name='Graendal'>Graendal</a>, p. 69&#x2014;One of the Forsaken, a fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair. Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing. She was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived. After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized the world could never live up to her standards. So she began dressing in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her and left little to the imagination. After being released from the Bore, Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of the Royal Family to use as servants. All of her servants are not only physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their society before she captured them. She includes in her collection the sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important figures. With <a href='#Sammael'>Sammael</a> dead, <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a> is the only person who knows how to find her. Graendal has been allowed limited access to the True Power through Moridin in recent days; she cannot take as much as she wants, but it is enough to, for example, take possession of a dove&apos;s mind and see through its eyes. Unbeknownst to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, Graendal <i>survived</i> his attack on Natrin&apos;s Barrow. Since he believes her dead, she feels she can plot against him&#x2014;or someone else important to him&#x2014;without anyone suspecting that she is involved. The <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a> was not happy that her actions resulted in the death of yet another of the Chosen, Aran&apos;gar, however, and put her soul in a new body. Her new body is exceedingly ugly, the person of <a href='#Hessalam'>Hessalam</a>. She is now forbidden to use her Chosen name. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Heartseeker'>Heartseeker</a>; <a href='#Hessalam'>Hessalam</a>. "
