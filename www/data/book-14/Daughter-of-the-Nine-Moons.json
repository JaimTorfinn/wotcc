She was <a href='#Tuon'>Tuon</a>, now called, as <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>, <a href='#Fortuona'>Fortuona</a>. <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage</a> attempted to disguise herself as the Daughter of the Nine Moons to secure a meeting with and capture <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>; Rand scheduled a meeting with the <i>real</i> Daughter of the Nine Moons so they could negotiate peace before Tarmon Gai&apos;don. That meeting failed miserably, and almost caused Rand to destroy the Seanchan before he suffered his crises of conscience at Dragonmount. Shortly after that meeting, Tuon declared herself <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>, thereby killing (in the proverbial sense) the Daughter of the Nine Moons. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tuon'>Paendrag, Tuon Athaem Kore</a>.
