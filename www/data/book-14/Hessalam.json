She is the reincarnation of <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>. Her new name means &#x201C;Without Remorse&#x201D; in the Old Tongue. She is now forbidden to use her Chosen name, and is even lower in the eyes of the Shadow than <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>. "
