She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in the past several months. She wore jewelry to her meetings with <a href='#Masema'>Masema</a> for the sole purpose of giving it to him such that he would not ask for anything more; she also sent a letter to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> offering him her friendship and asking for his help. She was subsequently captured by the Shaido Aiel, and is now one of <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>&apos;s followers. She escaped during the battle between <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> (assisted by the Seanchan) and the Shaido. She seems to think herself more politically adept than she actually is. She has hair like the Sun. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Masema'>Dagar, Masema</a>. "
