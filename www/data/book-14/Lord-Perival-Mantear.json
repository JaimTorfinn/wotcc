He pledged the support of House Mantear to <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> on his first trip to Caemlyn. His House controlled the Lion Throne until the death of Queen Mordrellen, both because the <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir</a> disappeared and because the family had become heavy with male children. He and his House are among Elayne&apos;s most adamant supporters. "
