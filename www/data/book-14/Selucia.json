She kept the right side of her head shaved clean, the other side braided, while Tuon was merely the heir; now that she is Empress, Selucia shaves the left side and is growing out the right. Until her hair grows out, she has taken to wearing a cloth on the right side. She is the one who shaves Fortuona&apos;s head every morning. She has golden hair, piercing blue eyes, skin the color of buttery cream, and an &#x201C;impressive&#x201D; bosom, but she is <i>not</i> soft: she could give sandpaper pointers on being rough. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Fortuona'>Paendrag, Fortuona Athaem Devi</a>; <a href='#Tuon'>Paendrag, Tuon Athaem Kore</a>.
