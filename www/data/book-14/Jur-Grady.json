He accompanied <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> after the episode at Dumai&apos;s Wells, and later left with <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> to seek out <a href='#Masema'>Masema</a>. He looks like a farmer. He cannot make a gateway large enough for a wagon. He has a wife, Sora, and a son, Gadren, back at the Black Tower. His father could channel as well, and was gentled shortly after he was born. He died a relatively short time later. He and <a href='#Neald'>Neald</a> both almost died from a bubble of evil that struck Perrin&apos;s camp&#x2014;the highly poisonous snakes appear to have attacked only those who could channel. He was pale and hollow-eyed from the effects of the illness for quite a while afterward. "
