He is tall and keeps his hair in a powdery white mohawk. He and <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a> were the two primary leaders of the Return. His ancestors supported Luthair&apos;s quest to be the first Seanchan Emperor. Suroth loathed him, primarily because she saw him as the only real threat to her <i>own</i> plan to make herself <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>. He is a member of the High Blood. He has wide shoulders. Now that <a href='#Fortuona'>Fortuona</a> has declared herself Empress, Galgan serves as her general of the army. He seems to distrust <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, either because he views him as a threat to the Empire or because he is uncertain of Mat&apos;s loyalty. He has been sending assassins after Fortuona, but she insists they are intended to fail, as they are not trained Seanchan assassins. "
