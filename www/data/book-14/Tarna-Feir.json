{"id":"Tarna-Feir","name":"Tarna Feir","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 2: The Choice of an Ajah","info":"<a class='name' name='Tarna'>Tarna Feir</a>, p. 96&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, later <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> in the White Tower under <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>. Elaida had sent her to Salidar to communicate with the Aes Sedai there and report about their camp and their numbers. She has long, pale, yellow hair, a strong jaw, and blue eyes that could freeze the Sun. She was a wilder, and had her block beaten out of her by Galina Casban; she and Galina were pillow friends as novices and/or Accepted, but Tarna rebuffed her advances once she gained the shawl. She is as jumpy as a novice, but has a cold manner. She came to <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> with a suggestion that Red sisters bond Asha&apos;man as Warders. They later went to the Black Tower to seek out Warders among the Dedicated. She shared a tent with <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> in the Black Tower. <i>Editor&apos;s Note: Tarna said at one point that Galina &#x201C;knew [her] Ajah long before [she] did, and took a personal interest in [her].&#x201D; I once thought it was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would choose. It would have fit with the idea of most Aes Sedai in the Tower being Black. However, it has since been revealed that Galina&apos;s interest in Tarna was more personal.</i> "}]}
