She was weary-eyed and resigned the first day <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a> met her, when she gave Faile her golden belt signifying service to Sevanna. Her time as <i>gai&apos;shain</i> toughened her a lot. She was the one who took Faile to see that <a href='#Arrela'>Arrela</a> and Lacile had been captured, then led her to Sevanna for her own punishment. Before leaving her with Sevanna, however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile&apos;s new last name. She knew Faile planned to escape, and wanted to help&#x2014;provided she could escape as well. She was once a noble in Amadicia, though she stubbornly refuses to admit that fact since her capture. Her face is plump, but still haggard from her captivity. She acted as the unofficial Steward of <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> and Faile&apos;s camp. She claims there is nothing left for her in Amadicia, and she may be right. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Pansai'>Pansai</a>. "}]}
