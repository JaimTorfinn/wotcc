She long wanted to marry <a href='#Loial'>Loial</a>, and although he liked her, he avoided her for a long time because he was convinced she would not want to live the nomadic life such as he needed to lead for the next few years in order to write his book. Loial considers her quite beautiful, at least by Ogier standards. She and Loial were married some months ago. Erith is not a Treesinger, but she can still tell that the trees do not &#x201C;feel&#x201D; right due to the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s touch. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Loial'>Loial</a>. "
