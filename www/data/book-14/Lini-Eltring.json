She has many wise sayings, which Elayne and Morgase are fond of quoting to themselves and others (probably because they have been ingrained into their minds so much). She went with Morgase when she fled Andor to Amadicia, and now serves as <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>&apos;s chief maid. She is bony, and has white hair. In Faile&apos;s absence, she worked with <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> to get her back. "
