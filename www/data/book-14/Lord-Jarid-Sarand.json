A square-faced man, he is dark for an Andorman. During the Succession, Jared&apos;s House opposed <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>; after she became Queen, he was only allowed into the Palace on state occasions. When <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> killed <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> and took control of Caemlyn until he could find <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, Jarid tried to make himself fall into favor, thinking he could gain power with the new ruler. He and his wife have been exiled, and supported Arymilla&apos;s claim to the Lion Throne. He still supports Elenia&apos;s attempt to claim the throne for herself. He is very honorable, almost too much so. Since Elayne&apos;s ascention to the Lion Throne, he has been the most troubling holdout against her. His hair has grown loyal through the months of his exile. He continually demands <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>&apos;s head, claiming she and the rest of the Aes Sedai are responsible for the strange events in the world. His men are beginning to grow weary of providing their support, realizing that no human could perpetrate the events they are witnessing. He has ten personal guards, who wear his symbol: a golden bear charging before a read spear. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Bayrd'>Bayrd</a>; <a href='#Davies'>Davies</a>; <a href='#Eri'>Eri</a>; <a href='#Karam'>Karam</a>; <a href='#Morear'>Morear</a>; <a href='#Rosse'>Rosse</a>; <a href='#Elenia'>Sarand, Elenia</a>.
