He is the one who gave orders to <a href='#Masema'>Masema</a> before he became the <a href='#Prophet'>Prophet</a>. He is missing one eye, has a long scar across his face, and has a hairstyle like the typical Shienaran warrior&#x2014;a topknot tied together and the rest of the head shaved clean. He is currently commanding a unit in <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a>&apos;s army. He finds it difficult to form a complete sentence, or even part of one, without cursing. He fears and respects <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>; one of her favorite activities is to make him speak to her without cursing. Though he is not an officer, he has spent years training heavy cavalry, and few if any are better in the saddle. "
