She had no Warders, which is extremely unusual for a Green, for most of her life. She was raised to the shawl about three years ago, and as yet is too new to the shawl to have the ageless look. She was captured at Dumai&apos;s Wells and is now a prisoner of the Aiel. According to <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewing of her, she will bond one of the Asha&apos;man as a Warder. She is pretty, and has high cheekbones and slightly tilted brown eyes. She often tries too hard to prove herself. She eventually bonded <a href='#Karldin'>Karldin Manfor</a> as her Warder. She died shortly after he did, both of them exhuasted from channeling as long as they had. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Karldin'>Manfor, Karldin</a>. "}]}
