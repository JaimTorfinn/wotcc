She has gray-streaked golden hair. She left Caemlyn with Reanne days before Arymilla&apos;s army appeared. She became High Seat of her house at age fifteen when her father died in a skirmish on the Altaran Marches. Elayne has admitted on several occasions that Dyelin would probably make a very capable Queen of Andor. Fortunately for Elayne, she has no desire whatsoever to attain the Throne. Unlike <a href='#Lir'>Lord Lir</a>, she realizes that Caemlyn is lost. "
