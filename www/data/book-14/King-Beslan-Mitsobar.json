{"id":"King-Beslan-Mitsobar","name":"King Beslan Mitsobar","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 11: Just Another Sell-Sword","info":"<a class='name' name='Beslan'>King Beslan Mitsobar</a>, p. 246&#x2014;King of Altara, and son of the late <a href='#Tylin'>Queen Tylin</a>. He is mild-mannered, has olive skin, a soft voice, sharp eyes, and black hair to his shoulders. He was of course a puppet of the Seanchan government while acting as king of Altara, but it <i>did</i> make him the equal of <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a> under the law. He was secretly plotting a resistance to the Seanchan, but changed his loyalties when confronted with the choice of loyalty or death. His head is now shaven, in the manner of the Blood, leaving only a dark strip on top. Seven of his fingernails are lacquered, one more than anyone this side of the Aryth Ocean with the exception of <a href='#Fortuona'>Fortuona</a> herself. Beslan has not plotted against her since their last confrontation, which surprises Fortuona&#x2014;<i>all</i> of her rivals in Seanchan would have plotted against her given the same circumstances.
