            "info": "<a class='name' name='Tuon'>High Lady Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag</a>, p. 246&#x2014;Second daughter of <a href='#Empress'>Empress Radhanan</a>, heir to the Crystal Throne of Seanchan, and leader of the <i>Corenne</i>, the Return. She has brown eyes and black hair (it was shaven off as is the custom of those of the High Blood until it grew back in as part of her travels with <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>). She was also called the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, the woman Mat was told he will marry. Mat later kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she traveled with him under strictest secrecy for some time. She is very small&#x2014;short and slender. She is, however, 20 years old, about the same age as Mat. She has very long eyelashes. She was presumed dead by <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a>, but Suroth took no chances: she sent parties out to find her, and kill her. Unfortunately for Suroth, Tuon intercepted one of her would-be assassins and ordered Suroth reduced to <i>da&apos;covale</i>. Tuon has since declared herself <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>, and as such Tuon is considered dead&#x2014;she took a new name, <a href='#Fortuona'>Fortuona</a>, and at the moment she accepted that name, Tuon ceased to exist. This does not stop Mat from calling her that, of course: he thinks the use of such name changes to be frivolous or even pathological. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>; <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>; <a href='#Empress'>Empress (of Seanchan), The</a>; <a href='#Fortuona'>Paendrag, Fortuona Athaem Devi</a>; <a href='#Selucia'>Selucia</a>; <a href='#Varuota'>Varuota</a>.
