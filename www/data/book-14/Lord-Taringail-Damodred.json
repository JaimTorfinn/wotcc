{"id":"Lord-Taringail-Damodred","name":"Lord Taringail Damodred","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 19: The Choice of a Patch","info":"<a class='name' name='Taringail'>Lord Taringail Damodred</a>, p. 368&#x2014;A Prince of Cairhien and First Prince of the Sword of Andor until his death. His first wife, <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a>, then the <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, bore him a son, <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>, before she vanished, causing the War of Succession. After the war was over, he married <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase Trakand</a>, the new Queen. Taringail and Morgase had two children, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. He died when Elayne was barely old enough to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase; unbeknownst to her, he had planned to engineer her death and make himself the first King of Andor in a millenium. Gawyn has few memories of him, but remembers that he was tall and handsome, with slight waves in his hair. Morgase remembers all too well how he tried to manipulate her, succeeding more often than not. He died hunting. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
