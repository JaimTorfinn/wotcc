She is slender, has black eyes, and grew up in Kandor. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> had a viewing of her: she will found a library. She was later one of <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a>&apos;s companions. She is one of a handful of people to ever be able to ignore Cadsuane. She retained her loyalty to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> until the bitter end, though she is now part of <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>&apos;s team that protects Rand, suggesting that she was loyal to the Tower, or perhaps Cadsuane, not Elaida.
