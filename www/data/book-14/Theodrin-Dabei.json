She was among the four raised to full sisterhood by <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. Before being raised, she tried to dismantle <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s block without success. The rest of the sisters still treat her like an Accepted. She has coppery skin, and grew up in Arad Doman. She has a stubborn set to her mouth, but she is warm to Egwene. She swore, of her own volition, to obey Egwene, and spied on <a href='#Romanda'>Romanda</a> for a time. She was subsequently sent as part of an embassy to the Black Tower; she is still looking for a Warder among the Dedicated and Soldiers. "
