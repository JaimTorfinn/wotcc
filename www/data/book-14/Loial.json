            "info": "<a class='name' name='Loial'>Loial</a>, p. 194&#x2014;Son of <a href='#Arent'>Arent</a> son of <a href='#Halan'>Halan</a>, an Ogier from Stedding Shangtai. He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to see the world; by Ogier standards, he was not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders. He is fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger. He is writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>. Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to marry him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother&apos;s choice of wives for him, <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>. He, like most of the Ogier, is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him. Loial&apos;s mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now married. He spoke to the Stump at Stedding Shangtai, convincing them to intervene in the Last Battle. Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually be called <i>The Dragon Reborn</i> and will catalog everything he has been through with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as well as any details he has been able to pry out of them. He has always had a secret desire to be hasty, as he perceives all humans to be. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Arent'>Arent</a>; <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>; <a href='#Halan'>Halan</a>. "
