He had been a good ruler for over twenty years, though the Council had recently smuggled him out of Bandar Eban&#x2014;after leaving the city, he seemed to have taken on the notion that he was the Rebirth of <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>. He was believed to either be dead or one of <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>&apos;s playthings, though he has since turned up very much alive and in control of his own mind. <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> also tried to capture him and keep him under White Tower control. He has since joined the nations at the Field of Merrilor, much to the surprise of <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> and the Aes Sedai (who presumed him dead). "
