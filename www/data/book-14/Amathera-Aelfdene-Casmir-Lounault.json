She vanished, allegedly at Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies. In reality, Amathera was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under Liandrin, and was rescued by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>. They had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the mob outside the Panarch&apos;s Palace (since it is not all that far from &#x201C;The Panarch is dead!&#x201D; to &#x201C;Death to the Panarch!&#x201D;), then she returned to her position. When the Seanchan invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant. She served as a dancer for <a href='#Suroth'>High Lady Suroth</a>, the leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces, until she was rescued by <a href='#Juilin'>Juilin Sandar</a>, who took her along when he fled Ebou Dar with <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>. She and Juilin have become an item since that time; he has been training her, with limited success, to stop flinching every time a Seanchan officer walks by. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Juilin'>Sandar, Juilin</a>.
