His ship was captured by <a href='#Tamarath'>Egeanin</a> at Falme, and she was afraid Domon would recognize her the next time they met. She was right&#x2014;he did. He became one of Egeanin&apos;s <i>so&apos;jhin</i>. When Egeanin captured his ship, he was trying to drop the male <i>a&apos;dam</i> in the ocean. The two became involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay together), which no one else seemed to understand&#x2014;anyone who talks to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along with. He is now <a href='#Leilwin2'>Leilwin</a>&apos;s husband and used to be <i>so&apos;jhin</i> until they fled the Seanchan provinces. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> describes him as &#x201C;not to bad a guy&#x201D; except when he is around Leilwin. Since he is always around her, Mat considers him unmanageable. He knew where the Tower of Ghenjei was, and led Mat to it. He has thick, roughened fingers. <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> still has not forgiven him for letting his ship be captured by Egeanin, which is how <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage</a> acquired the Domination Band Nynaeve had ordered Domon to drop into the ocean. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Leilwin2'>Shipless, Leilwin</a>; <a href='#Tamarath'>Tamarath, Egeanin</a>.
