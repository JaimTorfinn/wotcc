He cut the first&apos;s head off, <i>threw</i> his sword at the second and speared him with it, and took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it. He is wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot. He is fond of teasing women. He claimed to have been a merchant&apos;s guard, then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn. He later became a lieutenant in the Queen&apos;s Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her bodyguard. He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or handsome. He moves with a swordsman&apos;s grace, and is very strong. Mellar claimed to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claimed to have fought on <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>&apos;s side during the Succession. Half the palace, and a significant number of troops in the Andoran army, accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne&apos;s twins, which she allowed to continue to protect their true father&apos;s identity. Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else until it was too late, he also answers to the name <a href='#Hanlon'>Daved Hanlon</a>, a Darkfriend. To Mellar, a name is akin to a coat&#x2014;to be changed regularly and to suit the conditions. Elayne grew more than suspicious of his loyalties, and eventually had Hark follow him to see who he was meeting. It was the Black sisters; Elayne arrested him immediately.
