She had light hair similar in color to <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. According to the memories of Lews Therin&apos;s that used to flash through <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s head, Ilyena never flashed her temper at Lews Therin when she got angry at herself. Lews Therin often wailed for her loss for hours on end; these rants were usually started by anything and everything having to do with women, love, hate, killing, friends, or enemies. It is evident that <a href='#Demandred'>Demandred</a> also fancied Ilyena, and the fact that she fell for Lews Therin only deepened his hatred of him. She was the last of the names expunged from Rand&apos;s list. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lews'>Telamon, Lews Therin</a>. "
