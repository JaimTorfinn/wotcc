She was stilled by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> during the battle at Dumai&apos;s Wells. She has since been Healed by <a href='#Flinn'>Damer Flinn</a>, and is now an apprentice of the Wise Ones and oathsworn to Rand. She even wears Aiel jewelry, and has since taken charge of the previously stilled sisters in Cairhien. She has curly hair and a face that does not seem like that of an Aes Sedai. She and Samitsu are the closest things Cairhien had to rulers in <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s absence, at least until <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> assumed the Throne. She was captured with Compulsion by <a href='#Hessalam'>Hessalam</a> during the battle at Thakan&apos;dar; Hessalam wore her out by drawing too much of the Power through her for too long. "}]}
