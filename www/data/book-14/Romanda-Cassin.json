She grew up in Far Madding. She is the eldest of the Sitters in the Hall of the Tower. She sat in the Hall for eighty years before retiring, and came out of her retirement when news of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> came to her. She led one of the two factions in the Hall of the Tower during the rebellion. Romanda was also the First Weaver, the head of the Yellow Ajah, among the rebels, and likely retains that title now that the Tower is whole again. She was present at <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s test for the shawl. "}]}
