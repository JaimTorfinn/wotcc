His father was a cobbler in Arafel. He is now one of the Asha&apos;man. He is loyal to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, not <a href='#Taim'>Taim</a>. After being placed on the Traitor&apos;s List, he went in to hiding&#x2014;he did not assist in the attack on Rand, but Rand thought it better to be safe than have him killed. He has since been bonded as a Warder by <a href='#Merise'>Merise</a>. He wielded <i>Callandor</i> at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i>, though the circle was controlled by one of the women. Merise took away his dragon pin at first, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in lieu of his new responsibilites as her Warder&#x2014;Jahar was very angry with her for this, and eventually learned to give him respect appropriate to his position. Jahar was instrumental in exposing <a href='#Halima'>Halima</a> and Delana; he detected a man trying to pierce the ward against eavesdropping around the Hall of the Tower, after which Delana promptly excused herself and she and Halima fled the camp. He traveled with <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> in Tear as one of three full Asha&apos;man in the group. Rand realized that trusting Narishma was a near-insane risk, but one that was evidently worth taking. It appears that his trust was not misplaced. Narishma mentioned to Rand that he had not told him everything about how to disarm the wards he left around <i>Callandor</i>. Rand was convinced he <i>had</i> told him everything, which is puzzling. Perhaps Rand merely forgot, or perhaps Rand had left it warded against disarmament by, say, someone other than him, forgot about it before sending Narishma. Narishma&apos;s loyalty seems to indicate that he is <i>not</i> a Darkfriend. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Merise'>Haindehl, Merise</a>. "}]}
