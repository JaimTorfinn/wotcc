She grew up in Arad Doman. She has coppery skin and a swan-like neck, and is fond of thin, clinging dresses.

When in Tanchico, Jeaine tried to kill <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> with the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that produces balefire. Liandrin refuses to believe that she even <i>saw</i> Nynaeve there, much less attacked her. Jeaine attempted to disguise herself as <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a> to get past <a href='#Thom'>Thom</a> into the Pit of Doom&#x2014;Thom acted like he was convinced, then casually threw a knife at her, severing her spine.
