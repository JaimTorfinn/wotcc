            "info": "<a class='name' name='Kwamesa'>Kwamesa</a>, p. 627&#x2014;Former Sitter for the Gray Ajah, the youngest Sitter in the Hall of the Little Tower. She is dark and slender, and has strength in the Power; she was on the same level as <a href='#Sheriam'>Sheriam</a>. She tries to seem tall even though she is not. She grew up in Arafel, and she seems to put great store in ceremony. She is far too young to be a Sitter, at least under normal circumstances. She has a sharp nose. It is not known whether she retained her seat in the Hall after the Tower was reunited. She is now in charge of protecting the dragons from the Sharan army. She was killed by <a href='#Demandred'>Demandred</a> with balefire while he was the head of a full circle of 72; the balefire was strong enough to burn her thread out of the Pattern for several hours.
