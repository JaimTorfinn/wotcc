She is short, shaggy, and quite docile. <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> rode her out of Emond&apos;s Field when she left with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>. <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> suggested her as a way to take Egwene with them. She was later used by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> to leave Tar Valon on their way to Salidar, and now <a href='#Olver'>Olver</a> rides her. Olver does not think Bela to be a bad horse, but he prefers <a href='#Wind2'>Wind</a>, his racehorse. Bela is a stronger and fitter horse than she seems at first glance. "
