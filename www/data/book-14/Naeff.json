            "info": "<a class='name' name='Naeff'>Naeff</a>, p. 158&#x2014;One of the Asha&apos;man. He has a strong, rectangular face and a lean build. He is tall. He is very Talented with Air, which is rare for a man, and helped <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a> prevent a runaway fire during a bubble of evil. He resigned from the Andoran guards after <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> took over. He was among the first of the Asha&apos;man to be bonded by Aes Sedai as a Warder, and unlike most Asha&apos;man has always been very polite to Aes Sedai. He traveled with <a href='#Flinn'>Flinn</a> and <a href='#Narishma'>Narishma</a> as the only three Asha&apos;man in <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s coterie in Tear. His madness manifested itself in a very peculiar way: he &#x201C;saw&#x201D; Myrddraal in shadows that no one else could sense. <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> felt great pity for him while they were working together, so she Delved him to see if there was something she could Heal with respect to his madness. She succeeded&#x2014;she compared it to removing Compulsion, except with much darker forces at work&#x2014;and he no longer sees the Myrddraal everywhere. Unfortunately, she was unable to do the same for Rand, though it appears another force has intervened to stop his madness in its tracks. "
