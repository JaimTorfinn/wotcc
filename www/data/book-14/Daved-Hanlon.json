{"id":"Daved-Hanlon","name":"Daved Hanlon","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 37: The Last Battle","info":"<a class='name' name='Hanlon'>Daved Hanlon</a>, p. 768&#x2014;Real name of <a href='#Mellar'>Doilin Mellar</a>, the man who &#x201C;saved&#x201D; <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> from the three assassins. In gratitude, she named him Captain of the Queen&apos;s Bodyguard. He is a Darkfriend, and works for Shiaine. He is not bulky, and little taller than the average run of men. He feigned a relationship with <a href='#Falion'>Falion Bhoda</a> so that the two could exchange information discreetly. He was arrested by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> when she discovered evidence that he was visiting Black sisters. He later escaped, with Darkfriend assistance, from the dungeons under the Palace. He promises that he will hunt down <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and rape and kill her himself. Like <a href='#Raen'>Raen</a> and <a href='#Ila'>Ila</a>, Hanlon helps tend to the injured, wounded, and dead at the Battle of Merrilor. Unlike them, Hanlon and his men are <i>looting</i> the bodies. He still has the copy of <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>&apos;s foxhead medallion that he stole from Elayne. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Hanlon'>Hanlon, Daved</a>; <a href='#Mellar'>Mellar, Doilin</a>. "}]}
