Kari was not actually his biological mother; Rand&apos;s real mother was a Maiden of the Spear who bore him on Dragonmount where he was found by Kari&apos;s husband, <a href='#Tam'>Tam</a>. Kari met Tam while he was stationed in Caemlyn during his military duties, and the two got married. They returned to Tam&apos;s home, Emond&apos;s Field, with the child he found on the mountain at the end of the Aiel War, which they named Rand. Kari died when Rand was about five years old; she was the only mother Rand ever knew, and all he remembers of her was her soft touch. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Tam'>al&apos;Thor, Tamlin</a>.
