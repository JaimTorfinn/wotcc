He has two wives: <a href='#Amys'>Amys</a>, a Wise One, and Lian, roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold. <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> put him in charge of Cairhien along with <a href='#Berelain'>Berelain</a>, but Cairhien has now been turned over to local government. Rhuarc and many members of his clan brought order (if not precisely peace) to Arad Doman at Rand&apos;s command. He has since Traveled with Rand to Tear, and now wears the red headband of the <i>siswai&apos;aman</i> (spears of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>), despite being a clan chief. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amys'>Amys</a>.
