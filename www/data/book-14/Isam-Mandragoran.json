{"id":"Isam-Mandragoran","name":"Isam Mandragoran","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue: By Grace and Banners Fallen","info":"<a class='name' name='Isam'>Isam Mandragoran</a>, p. 23&#x2014;A man, at least in appearance, created by the Shadow some years ago. It was Isam who brought the Trollocs through the Ways to attack Emond&apos;s Field when <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> went back to defend it. He was later sent by <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a> to murder <a href='#Fain'>Padan Fain</a>. He is the same Isam that disappeared into the Blight years ago, Isam Mandragoran, <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s cousin. He has a mysterious ability to enter <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> in the flesh without a Gateway and leave it the same way, as well as change personalities and become <a href='#Luc'>Luc Mantear</a>, the brother of <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a> and uncle of <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a> and <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, who disappeared into the Blight years ago. The Shadow&apos;s minions call him, &#x201C;the man with two souls.&#x201D; He is also <a href='#Slayer'>Slayer</a>. He was recently assigned to kill <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, with <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>&apos;s help. They failed, and instead caused Mesaana&apos;s death in the process. He has also been assigned at various times to kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, though the Forsaken continually give him new orders, distracting him from that task. Isam went to the Shadow, hoping that he could be given the ability to channel; even the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a> could not grant that, but he was able to unite Isam&apos;s soul with Luc&apos;s to make him unique. Isam now considers himself a hunter, and that is all he desires to be. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Isam'>Mandragoran, Isam</a>; <a href='#Luc'>Mantear, Luc</a>; <a href='#Slayer'>Slayer</a>. "}]}
