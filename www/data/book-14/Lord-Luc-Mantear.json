            "info": "<a class='name' name='Luc'>Lord Luc Mantear</a>, p. 26&#x2014;Son of Queen Mordrellen of Andor and brother to <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a>. Gitara Moroso, then advisor to the Queen, told him that his fame&#x2014;or his fate&#x2014;lay in the Great Blight. He disappeared from Andor into the Blight shortly before <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a> disappeared, and was never seen again. Luc&apos;s soul in fact was merged with the soul of <a href='#Isam'>Isam Mandragoran</a>, <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s cousin, who disappeared into the Blight at about the same time. Luc/Isam now roams <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> as a unified entity that can change back and forth between the two identities readily. The combined entity now serves as an assassin for the Shadow, whom the wolves call <a href='#Slayer'>Slayer</a>. It was Luc who killed the Gray Man that <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> stumbled upon in the Tower. He may also have killed Herid Fel. Luc is aware that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> is his nephew. He bears a deep loathing for <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>, who foiled his plans in the Two Rivers and nearly killed him. Luc is usually more accommodating than his alter ego, Isam, but not when it comes to Perrin. <a href='#Gaul'>Gaul</a> compares Luc to a <i>lopinginny</i>, a bird from the Waste: he talks big, but is actually a coward. He went to the Blight wanting to become part of something important. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Isam'>Mandragoran, Isam</a>; <a href='#Slayer'>Slayer</a>. "
