            "info": "<a class='name' name='Flinn'>Damer Flinn</a>, p. 118&#x2014;Crease-faced old man with a limp, now one of the Asha&apos;man. He is bald with a fringe of white hair around the edge of his head. He was in the Queen&apos;s Guards until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired to help people with injuries. He came for the amnesty to see if he could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of Legends. He managed partially to Heal <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s wound in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does not seep into it anymore. Since he was placed on <a href='#Taim'>Taim</a>&apos;s Traitors&apos; List, he had been in hiding&#x2014;he did not assist in the attack on <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, but Rand thought it better to be safe than to have him killed. He has since been bonded as Warder to Corele, and attempted to teach Samitsu to do with <i>saidar</i> what he does with <i>saidin</i>. He was one of only three full Asha&apos;man to travel with <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> in Tear. Rand trusts him, and hopes to go to him some day to learn Healing. "
