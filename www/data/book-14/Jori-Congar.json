He will also drink so he cannot stand if given the chance. He is a good shot with a bow and arrows, close behind Jondyn. He is also a skilled pickpocket. Jori appeared in the false reality created by the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a> for <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, the reality that would exist if the Dark One prevailed. The real Jori Congar died during the Last Battle. <i>Editor&apos;s note: Jori Congar is not to be confused with Jori, Morvrin&apos;s Warder.</i> "
