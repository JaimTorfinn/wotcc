He touched the True Source for the first time when Aviendha was a girl: he made <i>algode</i> grow where it should not. He was kind to her. She watched him run across the dry ground at sunset, after vowing to spit in Sightblinder&apos;s eye. Aviendha now realizes that he was probably Turned to the Shadow once he got to Thakan&apos;dar. "
