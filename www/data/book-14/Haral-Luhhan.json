He is a very large man, which works well for work at the forge. His wife, Alsbet, is almost as large as he is, and nearly as strong. He approved of the new arrivals in Emond&apos;s Field, and even ventured into business partnerships with some of the newcomers. He is now fighting with <a href='#Tam'>Tam</a> and the other men from the Two Rivers, and was the first to reach Perrin when he pulled himself out of <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> into the waking world without a gateway. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>.
