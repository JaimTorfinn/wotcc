            "info": "<a class='name' name='Wyld'>Bao the Wyld</a>, p. 405&#x2014;Alleged savior of the Sharan people. He bears a striking resemblance to <a href='#Demandred'>Demandred</a>: dark hair, light skin, a hooked nose, and very handsome in general. He wears armor made of all coins, silvery and overlapping, polished to a mirror-like luster. His Sharan accent is not as thick as the others&apos; accents, likely because his is an imitation. The legend of Bao the Wyld is likely the Sharan equivalent of the Prophecies of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>, or at least an interpretation of their role in them. <i>Editor&apos;s note: we are led to assume that it was Demandred&apos;s theft of Bao the Wyld&apos;s persona that caused the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a> to laugh when Demandred asked him whether he had done well.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>; <a href='#Demandred'>Demandred</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#WhoIsOwned'>He Who Is Owned Only by the Land</a>.
