He was one of the nobles who opposed <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> during the Succession. Slender and strong, he is the High Seat of House Baryn. He was exiled from the Palace except for official functions by Morgase after she took the Lion Throne, but he invited himself back when <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> forced <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> out of town. He was later exiled again by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, though he has since thrown his lot in with her. He now advocates retaking Caemlyn from the Trollocs. His sign is a wing and hammer. "}]}
