He and his wife Natti lived in Emond&apos;s Field with their two unmarried daughters Eldrin and Bodewhin until Abell left with <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>. They have two other daughters. Abell is excellent with a bow and arrow, and is in general a really nice guy; Mat does not know of anyone that dislikes him. His remaining children are about the age where they start to leave home&#x2014;twenty, seventeen, and sixteen for Mat, Bode, and Eldrin, respectively. He is one of the best judges of horses around, and passed some of his knowledge on to his son. He serves as a subcommander under <a href='#Bashere'>Bashere</a> in the battle for Andor and Cairhien. Mat thinks there is no one who is as honest as he. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>. "
