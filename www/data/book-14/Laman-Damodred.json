            "info": "<a class='name' name='Laman'>Laman Damodred</a>, p. 81&#x2014;King of Cairhien about twenty years ago. His cutting of <i>Avendoraldera</i> to make a throne unlike anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War. The war continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed Laman and took his sword. Because of Laman&apos;s Pride, and his Sin, House Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never again reached any of its former glory&#x2014;but it also allowed Prophecy to be fulfilled; the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> was able to be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the Spear but raised by the blood of the old nations. His sword, a heron-mark, power-wrought blade with a jewel-encrusted handle, was captured by the Aiel as proof of his death at the end of the Aiel War; the sword was sold many times, each time at a lower price as the value of having proof of his death diminished, until it passed to <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. She gave it to Rand as payment of the debt she felt she owed him for saving her life and everything else he had done for her. He refused the scabbard and handle, letting her keep the jewels they contained, but kept the blade as payment in full of any debts between them. He still wears it. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Janduin'>Janduin</a>. "
