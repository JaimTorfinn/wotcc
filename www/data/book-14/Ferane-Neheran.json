She stepped down from the Hall of the Tower about ten years ago, but was recently re-appointed to the Hall by the White Ajah; no sister has <i>ever</i> rejoined the Hall that quickly. She is the head of the White Ajah, its First Reasoner. She grew up in Arad Doman, and has the coppery skin (and temper) typical of the Domani. She is a touch on the vain side.
