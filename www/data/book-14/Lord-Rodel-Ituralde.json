He keeps a neatly-trimmed mustache, and a ruby in his left ear. He is short in stature. He is called the Wolf by his peers&#x2014;when the Wolf calls, they follow his lead. He led a band of Taraboners and Domani to wreak havoc among the Seanchan. Even the Seanchan were impressed by his campaign. <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> has since conscripted him into defending Saldaea from the Trolloc hordes. He is a Blademaster. With <a href='#Alsalam'>Alsalam</a> presumed dead, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> wonders whether he has ascended to the Throne. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tamsin'>Ituralde, Tamsin</a>. "
