Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201D;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).

These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.

Her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&#x2014;this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.

It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>, <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a>, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well.

Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for herself, which means &#x201C;Daughter of the Night&#x201D; in the Old Tongue. She was born Mierin Eronaile, and was strong in the One Power. She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary facility for research into the One Power. Her final discovery there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed by men and women alike&#x2014;this source turned out to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s prison. She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin had a relationship with <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and influential man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him. Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married <a href='#Ilyena'>Ilyena Moerelle</a> she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin for leaving her. She declared as her territory the World of Dreams, <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown. She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin&apos;s soul&apos;s new body, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore. She first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, disguising her appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman. Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been &#x201C;unfaithful&#x201D; to her, and she tried to kill him.

On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including <a href='#Eldrin'>Eldrin</a> and <a href='#Bode'>Bodewhin</a>, who are 16 and 17, respectively.

However, she is not the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&#x2014;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive.

She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.

Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.

She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for al&apos;Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam</i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve now keeps Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam</i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, from severing to the wound on Rand&apos;s side. Nynaeve felt bad when <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death, or who that person is. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>; <a href='#Marigan'>Marigan</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.

He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair. He was raised by <a href='#Tam'>Tam al&apos;Thor</a> and his wife <a href='#Kari'>Kari</a> (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were <a href='#Janduin'>Janduin</a>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href='#Laman'>Laman</a>&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named <a href='#Shaiel'>Shaiel</a>, who was actually <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine Damodred</a>, the runaway <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the <a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <a href='#Dawn'>He Who Comes With the Dawn</a>, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. He has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &#x201C;under the forgotten symbol,&#x201D; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; break and bend knee to him, as well.

At the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul. This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends. This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison. At the moment of sealing, Shai&apos;tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broke at the battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak&apos;s collection (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch&apos;s Palace in Tanchico (broke enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found by <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim</a> (still intact).

He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style).

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to another Aes Sedai, and he was last seen leaving the wagons near Cairhien to seek her out. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Myrelle'>Berengari, Myrelle</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>.
