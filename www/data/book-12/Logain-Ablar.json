He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions. Before he was gentled, he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great power sometime in the future. Logain later came forward with information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to declaring himself the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more glory than gentling a simple man who could channel. Logain was eventually Healed by <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, and was set free by <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> to do as he pleased. He chose to go to the Black Tower, leading a part of the Asha&apos;man that seemed to be discontent with <a href='#Taim'>Taim</a>&apos;s leadership. When Aes Sedai came to the Black Tower to attempted to capture the Asha&apos;man (not realizing their numbers), Logain bonded two sisters to him as &#x201C;wives&#x201D; using the &#x201C;wife bond&#x201D; that the Asha&apos;man developed, Toveine Gazal of the Red Ajah and Gabrelle of the Brown Ajah. He has curly black hair and broad shoulders. Logain was actually a minor Ghealdanin noble before his titles were stripped away when he declared himself the Dragon Reborn. He now travels with the real Dragon Reborn, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#Taim'>Taim, Mazrim</a>.
