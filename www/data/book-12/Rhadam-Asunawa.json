He wants every woman affiliated in any way with the White Tower hanged as of yesterday, every book that mentions Aes Sedai or the White Tower burned, and the very words banned. He would have <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> hanged for her months in the Tower if Niall had let him. He witnessed <a href='#Valda'>Eamon Valda</a>&apos;s killing of Omerna subsequent to Niall&apos;s murder. He commands what Valda describes as an odd respect among the Children, even among those who despise the Questioners. "
