            "info": "<a class='name' name='Lelaine'>Lelaine Akashi</a>, p. 137&#x2014;Tall, slender Sitter for the Blue Ajah. She carries a dignified air about her. She was a Sitter in the White Tower for forty years until <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> was deposed. She is quite old. She now leads one of two factions that divides the Hall of the Tower under <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. Lelaine has a <em>strong</em> desire to hold the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> herself, enough that now that Egwene has been captured she sees an opportunity to seize it. She has taken to feigning support for Egwene to establish power in the Hall, anticipating that Egwene will not return. She is capable, strong-willed, and decisive. She is not beautiful, but she <i>is</i> pretty, particularly when she smiles. She is slender and graceful, with no gray in her dark hair. Her face is almond-shaped, with full lips. "
