            "info": "<a class='name' name='Anaiya'>Anaiya</a>, p. 150&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah. She had blunt, motherly facial features. She was very good friends with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> both as a novice and as a full sister. She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> was raised to the Striped Stole, and carried a position of considerable influence in the &#x201C;Little Tower&#x201D; in exile from Tar Valon. She dressed very simply, and very little upset her. She was Aes Sedai for 50 or 60 years before Kairen came to the Tower. She was killed, along with her Warder, presumably by <a href='#Arangar'>Arangar</a>; one would assume she began asking too many questions about <a href='#Halima'>Halima</a>&apos;s alleged mistress, Cabriana Mecandes, one of Anaiya&apos;s closest friends.
