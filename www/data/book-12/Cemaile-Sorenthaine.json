She was raised from the Gray Ajah. She was considered weak as Amyrlin. In memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler held a throne without the White Tower&apos;s approval, she had a gilded clock commissioned. The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after she died, and it didn&apos;t reappear until <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> put it back up when she was raised. The truth is worse than is generally known: Cemaile&apos;s tenure as Amyrlin would have been a complete disaster if the Ajah heads had not intervened. Long before the end of her reign, the most important decision they allowed her to make was which dress to wear. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat, The</a>. "
