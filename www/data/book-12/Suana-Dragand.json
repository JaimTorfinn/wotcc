            "info": "<a class='name' name='Suana'>Suana Dragand</a>, p. 196&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon, recently raised to a Sitter for the Yellow for the second time. She was hand-picked in a similar fashion to Juilaine, though she did serve in the Hall for forty years before resigning the first time. She is the First Weaver, the head of the Yellow Ajah. She is beefy, and has too much chin; she is all bones and skin. She is described as &#x201C;unyielding.&#x201D; Her quarters more closely resemble a garden than they do proper rooms. She has her own herb garden built into the inset balcony. <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> describes her as &#x201C;pleasant&#x201D;; she even suggested that Egwene join the Yellow Ajah despite Egwene&apos;s personal feelings that she was not strong in Healing.
