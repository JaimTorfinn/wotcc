She is slender in a bony sort of way. Her dark hair is streaked with gray, and she keeps it in a bun. Like many Browns, her clothing is out of date. She once said that Andor and Cairhien fought in more wars with each other than any two nations besides Tear and Illian. She grew up in Shienar. Her quarters are <i>filled</i> with books, and there are skeletons of various animals in various stages of assembly everywhere, including a complete <i>human</i> skeleton, so that there is barely room to walk. She is slender in a bony way. She typically wears dresses that went out of fashion a century or two ago. <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> suggested that there was a thirteenth Depository in the Tower library; when Bennae began to ask questions about such a Depository, her Ajah&apos;s higher-ups became hysterical. She has all but offered Egwene a place in the Brown Ajah. "}]}
