He became one of Egeanin&apos;s <i>so&apos;jhin</i>. When Egeanin captured his ship, he was trying to drop the male <i>a&apos;dam</i> in the ocean. The two are now involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay together), which no one else seems to understand&#x2014;anyone who talks to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along with. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tamarath'>Tamarath, Egeanin</a>.
