She has no Warders, which is extremely unusual for a Green. When <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> shielded her because she suspected her of being Black Ajah, she tried to stab her. She actually <i>is</i> a member of the Black Ajah, and is now sworn to obey Pevara and Seaine unconditionally. One of the three other Black sisters she knew of was Atuan. She was also exposed as a Black by <a href='#Verin'>Verin</a>. She fled the Tower weeks ago, most likely released from her Oaths and captivity by either <a href='#Mesaana'>Mesaana</a> or <a href='#Shaidar'>Shaidar Haran</a>. "
