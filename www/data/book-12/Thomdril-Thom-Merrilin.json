He is quite the ladies&apos; man. Thom is very good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks&#x2014;<a href='#Rodel'>Rodel Ituralde</a> once saw him performing at the Royal Court, and to say that he was impressed was to say that the sun is hot. He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread from Thom to <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Min'>Min</a>, and <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>. Thom was originally a bard in <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal Court, and for a time after her husband <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the Queen&apos;s lover. During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of it. Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do. He accompanied <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> on their travels as per <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s request, despite the fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah. Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried Dena was killed by Cairhienin soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i> against the Royal House. He has recently taken to traveling with Mat and his entourage, ever since hooking up with him again in Ebou Dar. Thom received a letter from <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> after her battle with <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a> stating that she was still alive in the land of the Eelfinn. He and Mat have plans to attempt rescue. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>. "}]}
