He was once humbled by <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin</a> in the Hall of Servants, and defeated by him at the gates of Paaren Disen. He turned to the Shadow for philosophical reasons: there was no path to victory for the Light. The only path to victory was to follow the Great Lord and rule for a time before all things ended. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Baal'>Ba&apos;alzamon</a>; <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>; <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a>.
