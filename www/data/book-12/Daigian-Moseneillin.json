            "info": "<a class='name' name='Daigian'>Daigian Moseneillin</a>, p. 121&#x2014;Plump, curvaceous, pale Aes Sedai of the White Ajah with long black hair. She is the youngest daughter of a lesser House in Cairhien. She is <i>extremely</i> weak in the One Power, possibly weaker than any woman ever to attain the shawl; many sisters consider her little better than a wilder. She spent longer as Accepted than any other woman in memory, and is rumored to have <i>barely</i> passed the test for the shawl. She is now sworn to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, and later bonded <a href='#Hopwil'>Eben Hopwil</a> as a Warder. She was very possessive of him, and she is now mourning his death, which occured during the cleansing of <i>saidin</i>; she cries for him nearly every night. She wears a stone on her forehead, as <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> did, though hers is a white moonstone. This tradition is typical of Cairhienin noblewomen. <!-- Note: Daigian is dead at the end of this book, killed by Semirhage. --> "
