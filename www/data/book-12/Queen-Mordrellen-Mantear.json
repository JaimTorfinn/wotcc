Her death and the previous disappearance of her daughter <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a> set off the Succession, called the Third War of Andoran Succession by those not from Andor.

I have little idea which one is actually correct, so I just picked this spelling. There is also a reference made to the character of Modrellein as the hero of Andor who rode into the middle of the battle 700 years ago, reversed the retreat, rallied the army, and won the battle&#x2014;I think this is probably who she was confused with.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>.
