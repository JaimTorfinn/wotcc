            "info": "<a class='name' name='Sheriam'>Sheriam Bayanar</a>, p. 72&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with fiery hair. She was <a href='#Novices'>Mistress of Novices</a> in the White Tower before she fled to Salidar with the rest of her Ajah. She led the group of six sisters that held most of the influence in Salidar, despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower. Her tilted, green eyes can be used to intimidate novices and Aes Sedai alike. She is now the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>. She is very efficient, but she hates the paperwork involved with being Keeper, and is often heard muttering under her breath that she wishes she were still Mistress of Novices. She has lost a considerable amount of weight recently. She has been beaten, apparently as a way to extract information, by an unknown assailant in recent weeks. She often wishes she&apos;d chosen the Brown Ajah, which would allow her to isolate herself from the Tower, politics, and stress in general. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>; <a href='#Novices'>Mistress of Novices</a>.
