            "info": "<a class='name' name='Beonin'>Beonin Marinye</a>, p. 72&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah. She is pretty, has honey-colored hair, and grew up in Tarabon. Her blue-gray eyes seem to constantly look startled. Nothing seems to surprise her, though, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> thinks she would not believe the Sun would come up unless she saw it herself, and if one morning it did not, she would just take it to confirm that she was correct to demand proof. She was one of the six sisters in Salidar that had most of the authority, despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower, and later served as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>&apos;s advisor from the Gray Ajah. Egwene was shocked to see she had returned to the Tower after Egwene was captured; she accused Beonin of betraying her, but Beonin denied it, and claims her oath still holds. She did, however, betray the spies sent to the Tower, though she claims she warned the spies from the Gray about it. Since her oath still holds, and by the Three Oaths Egwene knows she cannot lie, she has been conscripted to serve as Egwene&apos;s agent inside the Tower. "
