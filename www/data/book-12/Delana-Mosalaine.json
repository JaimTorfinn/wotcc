{"id":"Delana-Mosalaine","name":"Delana Mosalaine","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 8: Dragon's Eggs","info":"<a class='name' name='Delana'>Delana Mosalaine</a>, p. 150&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, openly a Sitter for the Gray Ajah in the &#x201C;Little Tower.&#x201D; She used to be the only Sitter that <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> thought she could count on for her support. She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored hair. She is from Shienar, and has no Warder. Delana started to cause trouble in the Hall, especially with her demand to make a formal declaration that <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> is Black Ajah. She was willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters would not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole. Her pale blue eyes give nothing away. Like many of her fellow members of the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter. Her maid is named <a href='#Halima'>Halima</a>, and she often lent her to Egwene; Halima was the only person who seemed to be able to make Egwene&apos;s headaches go away. Halima, of course, was <em>causing</em> Egwene&apos;s headaches, but she was not aware of that. Delana went pale and excused herself from the Hall when <a href='#Narishma'>Narishma</a> reported that a woman was able to channel <i>saidin</i> and then detected a someone attempting to break through the ward against eavesdropping with <i>saidin</i>. <a href='#Romanda'>Romanda</a> subsequently put two and two together, and demanded Delana be arrested. She and Halima had already left the camp. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Halima'>Saranov, Halima</a>. "}]}
