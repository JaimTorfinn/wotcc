{"id":"Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred","name":"Galadedrid (Galad) Damodred","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 13: An Offer and a Departure","info":"<a class='name' name='Galad'>Galadedrid (Galad) Damodred</a>, p. 214&#x2014;Son of <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>&apos;s late husband <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a> and his first wife <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a>. He is half-brother to <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>. Stunningly handsome; even <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai often forsook their work to watch him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard when he was in training. Galad has much skill with the sword, and has achieved Blademaster status in practice if not in name. He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that accompanied <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a>&apos;s deposition and joined <a href='#Valda'>Eamon Valda</a>&apos;s band of the Children of the Light. Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men. He says he became a Whitecloak because it &#x201C;felt right.&#x201D; He is extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it hurts, even himself. In fact, he started a war in Samara to help Elayne and Nynaeve escape. His sign is a winged silver sword, point down. Galad has feelings for <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, and although she is flattered by his attentions, she does not return his love. He is quite popular among his soldiers. Galad believes that Valda killed his mother after sexually abusing her, and killed him as punishment for this. He was incorrect about the killing part, at least. According to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s visions of <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>, Galad currently travels with Perrin. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>; <a href='#Valda'>Valda, Eamon</a>.
