His first wife, <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine</a>, the then <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, bore him a son, <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>, before she vanished, causing the War of Succession. After the war was over, he married <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase Trakand</a>, the new Queen. Taringail and Morgase had two children, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. He died when Elayne was barely old enough to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase; unbeknownst to her, he had planned to engineer her death and make himself the first King of Andor in a millenium. Gawyn has few memories of him, but remembers that he was tall and handsome, with slight waves in his hair. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
