The book is so revered among the Children that those who cannot read are taught so that they can study Mantelar&apos;s words. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> once read a few pages of it, and considered them &#x201C;dry nonsense,&#x201D; but <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a> thought Mantelar&apos;s words to be brilliant.
