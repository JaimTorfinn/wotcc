He is bald with a fringe of white hair around the edge of his head. He was in the Queen&apos;s Guards until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired to help people with injuries. He came for the amnesty to see if he could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of Legends. He managed to partially Heal <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s wound in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does not seep into it anymore. Since he was placed on <a href='#Taim'>Taim</a>&apos;s Traitors&apos; List, he had been in hiding&#x2014;he did not assist in the attack on <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, but Rand thought it better to be safe than to have him killed. He has since been bonded as Warder to <a href='#Corele'>Corele</a>, and attempted to teach <a href='#Samitsu'>Samitsu</a> to do with <i>saidar</i> what he does with <i>saidin</i>. He currently travels with <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Corele'>Hovian, Corele</a>. "
