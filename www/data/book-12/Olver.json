            "info": "<a class='name' name='Olver'>Olver</a>, p. 318&#x2014;Boy of nine who sat on the wrong horse and almost had his neck broken for the trouble. He was adopted after a fashion by <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and his Band of the Red Hand. His parents were killed when the Shaido ravaged Cairhien. He is short, pale, and quite ugly. He likes to chase women. He is a good horse racer, and travels with Mat and Luca&apos;s show. He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and does not seem to understand that there is no way to win without cheating. <i>Note: many people think that Olver may be the Rebirth of Gaidal Cain&#x2014;he is certainly ugly, as Gaidal was, and with <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewing of Birgitte&apos;s adventures with an ugly man both far older than she and far younger than she, it seems to fit. Also, there is speculation that Olver&apos;s obsession with Snakes and Foxes, which is based on dealings with the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, will allow him (or Mat, <a href='#Thom'>Thom</a>, or someone else who would observe his solutions) to puzzle out how to beat the Eelfinn and get <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> back from them. Personally, I think Olver is a red herring, at least on the first count.</i> "
