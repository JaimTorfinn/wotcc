She was actually <a href='#Delana'>Delana</a>&apos;s maid, but she lent her to Egwene at night to help Egwene with her chronic headaches. Halima is actually <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a>, a reincarnated Forsaken who channels <i>saidin</i> despite being female. She was <i>causing</i> Egwene&apos;s headaches, and then making them subside, in order to keep herself close to Egwene. It worked&#x2014;she usually slept on a pallet in Egwene&apos;s tent. She is stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a perfect face and a full, firm bosom. As she is posing as a poorly educated serving girl, she forms her letters with the awkwardness of a young child. She has developed a fondness for low-cut bodices. She got sloppy about bossing Delana around in public, leading <a href='#Romanda'>Romanda</a> and others to believe that Delana and Halima are &#x201C;pillow friends.&#x201D; Eventually, Romana saw the truth: Halima and Delana were both Darkfriends. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a>; <a href='#Delana'>Mosalaine, Delana</a>.
