            "info": "<a class='name' name='Doesine'>Doesine Alwain</a>, p. 204&#x2014;Sitter for the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon. Boyishly slim, and tall for a Cairhienin. Her father was a cutler. She ran away three times as a novice, although she only got as far as the gates once. She has a bit of a foul tongue. She managed to get Atuan questioned in the same manner <a href='#Talene'>Talene</a> was. She and <a href='#Saerin'>Saerin</a> walked in on <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine</a> and <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> when they were using the Oath Rod to question sisters; she promptly booted Seaine out of the leadership and seized the reins herself. She has blue eyes and wears a sapphire on her forehead in the Cairhienin style. "
