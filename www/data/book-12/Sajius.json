His book contains the line, &#x201C;He shall hold a blade of light in his hands, and the three shall become one.&#x201D; The traditional interpretation of this line is that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> will wield <i>Callandor</i> and unite three kingdoms under him. Min thinks, however, that this refers to the fact that <i>Callandor</i> must be wielded by a circle of three&#x2014;one man and two women. "
