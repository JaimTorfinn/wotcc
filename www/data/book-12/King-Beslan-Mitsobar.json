He is mild-mannered, has olive skin, a soft voice, sharp eyes, and black hair to his shoulders. He was of course a puppet of the Seanchan government while acting as king of Altara, but it <em>did</em> make him the equal of <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a> under the law. He was secretly plotting a resistance to the Seanchan, but changed his loyalties when confronted with the choice of loyalty or death. "
