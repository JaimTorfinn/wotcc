She was one of the sisters who took <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> into custody before she was deposed. She was a close confidant of <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> after she took over. She fled the Tower the day <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> was raised <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin</a>, though she was not on <a href='#Verin'>Verin</a>&apos;s list. Egwene suspects that she may have been one Verin missed. "
