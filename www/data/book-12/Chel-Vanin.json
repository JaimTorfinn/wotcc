He is a good rider, and Mat thinks he could steal a hen pheasant&apos;s eggs with her sitting on them (although he would likely steal her, too)&#x2014;he also thinks Vanin could steal a horse out from under a nobleman and he would not know it for two days. He has a large space between his front teeth. He went with Mat to Ebou Dar, and escaped the city with Mat to travel with Valan Luca&apos;s show. Mat discovered him by asking the me he <i>did</i> catch stealing who the best thieves were. He then asked the men <i>they</i> named the same thing. Vanin was the one named by the third or fourth group; he is the best Mat has ever seen. "
