He wears his hair in the Shienaran style, but without the topknot. He is old, with gray hair, and thin. He has brown eyes. He and Fanwar often play stones together, but his most recent trip to Fanwar&apos;s house was to tell him to pack up and leave to confront the Shadow. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Gallanha'>Gallanha</a>; <a href='#Mirala'>Mirala</a>.
