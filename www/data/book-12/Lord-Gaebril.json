He joined and led the faction that restored order in the city, and upon <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>&apos;s return, he gave her her kingdom in one piece, as it was when she left. Allegedly, she was so happy that he had done this that she made Gaebril her new advisor (and lover). However, during <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>&apos;s trip through Caemlyn to deliver <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>&apos;s letter, Mat overheard Gaebril ordering someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&#x2014;he tried to find a way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne. Gaebril was discovered to be <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a>, one of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him. His &#x201C;pretty woman&#x201D; was Morgase, and he planned to wrest control of Andor from her. Morgase realized he was controlling her and left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed; when Caemlyn was taken by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and Rahvin killed, the rumor changed to say that Rand had killed Morgase, instead of Gaebril. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a>.
