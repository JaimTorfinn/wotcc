            "info": "<a class='name' name='Logain'>Logain Ablar</a>, p. 23 (15)&#x2014;A false <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon</a> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah. He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions. Before he was gentled he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great power sometime in the future. Recently, Logain has come forward with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up to declaring himself the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would be less likely to be negatively critiqued than gentling a simple man who could channel. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.
