As a novice, she was good friends with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was present at <a href='#Gitara'>Gitara Moroso</a>&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>. After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came to lead the Blues&apos; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>. She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to date. When her lifelong connection to the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, <a href='#Leane'>Leane Sharif</a>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a>. Siuan hopes to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from Elaida&#x2014;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.

Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army. She had a Warder named <a href='#Alric'>Alric</a>, but he died when she was deposed. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elaida'>a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>; <a href='#Alric'>Alric</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Gitara'>Moroso, Gitara</a>; <a href='#Leane'>Sharif, Leane</a>.
