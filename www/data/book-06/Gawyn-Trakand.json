{"id":"Gawyn-Trakand","name":"Gawyn Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue: The First Message","info":"<a class='name' name='Gawyn'>Gawyn Trakand</a>, p. 40 (41)&#x2014;Son of <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother to <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. He will become First Prince of the Sword when Elayne becomes Queen. He and his half-brother <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess considerable skill with the sword. During the chaos that erupted after <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>&apos;s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which are Blademasters&#x2014;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. Gawyn does not know which party to support&#x2014;he believes that anyone who opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a> and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> side with those who broke from the Tower. This is especially difficult since Gawyn has feelings for Egwene, feelings which she returns. He believes the rumor that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. His sign is a white boar. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
