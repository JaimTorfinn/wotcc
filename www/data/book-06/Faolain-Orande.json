She has an extreme dislike for Wilders, and does not treat <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a>, who were stilled, very well either. She spent eight years as a novice, and five among the Accepted. She has since been raised to something more than Accepted, but still less than a full sister (due to the absence of the Oath Rod). "
