Hearing of <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s amnesty, Taim came to Caemlyn and became the head of Rand&apos;s school of male channelers. He is almost as strong in the One Power as Rand is. Taim claims to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint for almost 35 years&#x2014;he has been using the One Power for a very long time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or been taught by <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a>, such as how to test men for the ability. He seems to resent being second to Rand. <i>Editor&apos;s Note: There has been an ongoing debate on-line about whether <a href='#Demandred'>Demandred</a> had comandeered Taim&apos;s identity and was trying to bring Rand down by taking away support from men who can channel and making them loyal to him alone.
