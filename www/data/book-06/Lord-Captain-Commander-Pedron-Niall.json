He is one of the great military commanders in the world, in company with <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, <a href='#Agelmar'>Agelmar Jagad</a>, <a href='#Rodel'>Rodel Ituralde</a>, <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and several Aiel chiefs. He is trying to get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine will not invade both countries. He is also trying to expand Amadicia&apos;s borders into parts of Ghealdan. His headquarters is in Amadicia, and he rules there even above <a href='#Ailron'>King Ailron</a>, although this is not spoken of openly. Niall recently offered a treaty with <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> of Andor, offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence that Morgase had not allowed even a fraction of during her reign. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Balwer'>Balwer, Sebban</a>; <a href='#Omerna'>Omerna, Abdel</a>; <a href='#Valda'>Valda, Eamon</a>.
