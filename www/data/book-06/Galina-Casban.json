She has been head of the Red Ajah for eighteen years, although she is not a Sitter for the Red. Unknown to almost everyone, she is actually a member of the Black Ajah. She was the one who beat <a href='#Tarna'>Tarna Feir</a>&apos;s block out of her; Galina knew she would choose Red before Tarna did. Galina has a begrudgingly positive opinion of <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>, who she believes is proving herself to be strong and capabable. "
