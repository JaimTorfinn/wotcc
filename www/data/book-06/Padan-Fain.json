A Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field. While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of <a href='#Mordeth'>Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth. Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone. Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda. He has used his Mordeth-derived powers to spread suspicion of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a>, the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon, and <a href='#Niall'>Pedron Niall</a>, Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light. <!-- Page 408, LoC --> It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&#x201D; from observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the hearts of men.
