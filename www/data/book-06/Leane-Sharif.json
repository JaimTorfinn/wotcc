Just as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction; she could channel <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching. She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>. During the coup led by <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a> and <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and stilled. Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough. She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Anjen'>Anjen</a>; <a href='#Alviarin'>Freidhen, Alviarin</a>; <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>.
