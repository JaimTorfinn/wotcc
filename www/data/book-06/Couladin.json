He never went to Rhuidean, but declared himself the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i> after <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a> placed two dragons on his arms in a copy of those on <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>&apos;s arms. When the rest of the Aiel chiefs declared for Rand, Couladin took the Shaido west across the Spine of the World to ravage Cairhien.

After his death, the remnants of his clan fled to Kinslayer&apos;s Dagger under the command of his widow, <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>. His head was placed on a pike while Mat&apos;s troops danced around it and the rest of the Aiel spit on it. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>; <a href='#Suladric'>Suladric</a>. "
