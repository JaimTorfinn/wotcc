He is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the height of an average man and all the same height. His name means &#x201C;Hand of the Dark&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names come from the Trolloc tongue. He is given special consideration; the ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it does everyone else&apos;s. "}]}
