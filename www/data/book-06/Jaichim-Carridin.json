Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend. He was given orders (under the name Bors) by <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a> to find and kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead. So far, Carridin has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest sister Dealda (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade). He expects his sister, Vanora, to be next. "
