{"id":"Gaidal-Cain","name":"Gaidal Cain","chapters":[{"title":"Glossary","info":"<a class='name' name='Gaidal'>Gaidal Cain</a>, p. 704 (993)&#x2014;Hero of Legend bound to the Horn of Valere. He is a swordsman, and is always linked to <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a> in the stories. Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> has ever seen. Just being around him makes Nynaeve uncomfortable. Before being ripped out of <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, Birgitte mentioned that she had not seen Gaidal around for some time, indicating that he has been spun out into the Pattern again. She fears she will never see him again. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>. "}]}
