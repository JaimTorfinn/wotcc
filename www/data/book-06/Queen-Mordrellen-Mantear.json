I have picked this spelling because Modrellein is also named as the ruler of Andor over 700 years ago, and that would make Rand&apos;s maternal grandmother and awfully old woman.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Luc'>Mantear, Luc</a>; <a href='#Gitara'>Moroso, Gitara</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
