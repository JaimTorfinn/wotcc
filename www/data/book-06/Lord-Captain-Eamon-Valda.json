He commanded the troops that were near Tar Valon, and gave <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a> the information on the Whitecloaks when he said he was curious. Once Galad joined the Whitecloak army, Valda promoted him quickly because of his swordsmanship skill, claiming that he deserved recognition for his skill regardless of where he obtained it. Valda thinks that <a href='#Niall'>Pedron Niall</a>&apos;s time as Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light is coming to an end&#x2014;his skill as a military commander earned him the right to have the position as long as he has, but Valda thinks he is getting too old to be effective. Valda plans to succeed him himself, but letting others know of this would undoubtedly mean a dagger through Valda&apos;s ribs, so he keeps it to himself. "
