            "info": "<a class='name' name='Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>, p. 82 (101)&#x2014;Aiel of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Formerly a Maiden of the Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had the ability to channel inborn. She has green eyes, and is of age with <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>. She is more than pretty with dark, reddish hair. Aviendha is one of the three women in <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewing of Rand&#x2014;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as &#x201C;wetlanders&#x201D; did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She feels <i>toh</i> toward <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> for violating her trust, and denies her feelings for Rand until she can make it up to Elayne. She is often needled by the Maidens about liking Rand&apos;s eyebrows. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>; <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>; <a href='#Rhuarc'>Rhuarc</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
