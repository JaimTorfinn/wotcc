{"id":"Liandrin","name":"Liandrin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 15: A Pile of Sand","info":"<a class='name' name='Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>, p. 259 (359)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Red. She has light hair and a face like a doll. She grew up in Tarabon. She led the group of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process. Liandrin was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came to the Tower), so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at all. It was Liandrin who effectively sold <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> into slavery to the Seanchan as a <i>damane</i>; she attempted to do the same to <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. Egwene still has nightmares about her. Liandrin always seeks to gain power for herself through whatever means she can; this has recently gotten her on the bad side of <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>, and may bring about the very downfall in the ranks of the Shadow which she was trying to prevent.
