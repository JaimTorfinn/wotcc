Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, whose names were chosen for them by those they betrayed, Lanfear chose her name herself, which means &#x201C;Daughter of the Night&#x201D; in the Old Tongue. Besides her name, the only thing known about her is that during the Age of Legends, before <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> met <a href='#Ilyena'>Ilyena</a>, she was his lover. She believes that Lews Therin&apos;s <i>soul</i> is hers, no matter whose body it now inhabits."
