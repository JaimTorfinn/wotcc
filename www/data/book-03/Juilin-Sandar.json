He betrays <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> to <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> and her Black Ajah companions out of duty to the High Lords (and possibly because Liandrin used Compulsion on him), but later feels terrible about it and helps <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> rescue them from their dungeons in the Stone of Tear. He carries a notched sword-breaker and narrow staff; he is deadly with both. "
