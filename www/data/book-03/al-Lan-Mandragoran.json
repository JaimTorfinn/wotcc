For years, he fought a one-man war against the Shadow in the Blight, until being bonded as a Warder by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>. Lan is one of the best Warders, but he is very hard and stubborn, and is thus hard for Aes Sedai to deal with. He keeps a stone countenance, never revealing his true feelings to anyone&#x2014;although sometimes he cannot hide his feelings for <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>.
