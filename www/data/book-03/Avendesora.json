The location of <i>Avendesora</i> is unknown, though it apparently has some connection with the Aiel; they gave the people of Cairhien a gift over 500 years ago of a tree, <i>Avendoraldera</i>, that was grown from a cutling of <i>Avendesora</i>. <i>See also</i> <i><a href='#Avendo'>Avendoraldera</a></i>.
