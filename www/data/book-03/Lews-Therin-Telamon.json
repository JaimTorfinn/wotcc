He was perhaps the most influential man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai ever. He led the strike which resealed the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a> back into his prison, ending the Age of Legends and beginning the Time of Madness. Unfortunately, Lews Therin was driven insane along with the rest of the Hundred Companions with whom he resealed the prison; he went mad and killed everyone he loved as well as anyone who carried so much as one drop of his blood. For this reason, he was given the name Kinslayer, and his name is generally associated with evil, especially among the uneducated. He is especially despised by the Whitecloaks, the &#x201C;Children of the Light,&#x201D; who by their very name should be serving him. It is unfortunate that one of the greatest men who ever lived is as feared and despised as he is. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#Kinslayer'>Kinslayer</a>; <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a>; <a href='#Ilyena'>Moerelle, Ilyena Therin</a>.
