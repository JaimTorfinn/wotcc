This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, and was temporarily re-sealed by <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> and the Hundred Companions. Those seals are now growing weak (three have broken already), and the Dark One&apos;s influence is spreading. <i>Editor&apos;s Note: I thought it was appropriate that he was mentioned for the first time on page 666 of the paperback edition....</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Baal'>Ba&apos;alzamon</a>; <a href='#Creator'>Creator, The</a>.
