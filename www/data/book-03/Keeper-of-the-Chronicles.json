The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin. The post is currenlty held by <a href='#Leane'>Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah. In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin Seat and speaks for the Amyrlin Seat; she is all but separate from her Ajah, although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Beldeine'>Nyram, Beldeine</a>; <a href='#Leane'>Sharif, Leane</a>.
