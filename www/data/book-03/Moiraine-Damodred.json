            "info": "<a class='name' name='Moiraine'>Moiraine Damodred</a>, p. 32 (18)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah. From even before she became a full sister, she dedicated her life to finding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. She was a good friend of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> when she was in training. Moiraine was able to track the whereabouts of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> to a small village in western Andor, Emond&apos;s field, where she narrowed the list of candidates to three young men, all of whom were <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, who were born within days of each other. She guided these three away from Emond&apos;s Field, until an encounter at the Eye of the World revealed which of the three was truly the one: <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, who she found was actually born near Tar Valon on the slopes of Dragonmount and brought to Emond&apos;s Field by his adoptive father, <a href='#Tam'>Tam</a>. Moiraine bears much importance in the White Tower, and is involved in actions which many of her fellow sisters would think to be treason, actions she would most likely be stilled for if their full extent were known. These sisters do not understand just how important the Dragon Reborn actually is. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>. "
