She is quite fond of fish analogies, a result of being raised on a fishing boat in Tear. Siuan is one of only three Aes Sedai that knows that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> is the Reborn&quot;,Dragon Reborn. After <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> and the other twelve sisters that went with her left the Tower, Siuan has been afraid to trust anyone except <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, and <a href='#Verin'>Verin</a>, thinking that anyone else, possibly including <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a>, her Keeper of the Chronicles, could be Black Ajah without her knowing. This paranoia is probably the safest course, but causes an increased level of tension in the Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Leane'>Sharif, Leane</a>.
