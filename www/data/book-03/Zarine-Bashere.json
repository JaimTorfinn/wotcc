            "info": "<a class='name' name='Zarine'>Zarine Bashere</a>, p. 405 (324)&#x2014;Dark-haired woman that latches onto <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> and the group he&apos;s with. She is from Saldaea, but left home to become a Hunter of the Horn in Illian. She followed Perrin, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, and <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a> because she thought they would lead her to the Horn of Valere. She was dissapointed to find out that <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> had already blown it, and was shocked to find that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> is the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. She uses the name Faile, a name her father used to call her, meaning &#x201C;falcon.&#x201D; This scared Perrin, since he&apos;d been told by <a href='#Min'>Min</a> that she saw a falcon and a hawk fighting over him in her visions. Faile looks as if she has taken a liking to Perrin, and Perrin may be doing the same for her. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Faile'>Bashere, Faile</a>. "
