She is the widow of the last two chiefs of the Shaido, Suladric and Couladin, and has served as chief of the Shaido since Couladin&apos;s death. She will continue to do so until another chief can be chosen, but no one sees that event occuring in the near future. She has green eyes. She knows that the easiest way to power for herself is to attach herself to men who already hold power; she even envisioned marrying <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> (against his will) to gain power through him. She is currently leading her clan (and any Aiel deserters that joined her) through Ghealdan, where they were sent from Kinslayer&apos;s Dagger by Sammael. She constantly wants more <i>gai&apos;shain</i>&#x2014;her goal is to indenture the entire world. She has recently taken a fancy to wearing silk, and wears nothing else. She is tall, has pale green eyes, and hair like spun gold. She would be beautiful except for the strong hint of avarice around her plump mouth.
