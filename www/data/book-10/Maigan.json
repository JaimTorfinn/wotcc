She seems elongated somehow, though not tall. She was the Blue Ajah&apos;s replacement for <a href='#Anaiya'>Anaiya</a> on <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>&apos;s &#x201C;Council&#x201D; of sisters. She was one of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a>&apos;s allies when she was <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin</a>, but now she blames Siuan for breaking the Tower. She stands as high as <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a> or <a href='#Morvrin'>Morvrin</a> in the Power. Siuan was forced to beg for readmittance into the Blue Ajah, and Maigan was one of the ones who most insisted on the begging. She is <a href='#Lelaine'>Lelaine</a>&apos;s to her toenails. "
