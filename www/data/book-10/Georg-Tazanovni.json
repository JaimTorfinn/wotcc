He was twelve when he was murdered by Darkfriends in an uprising that also killed the rest of Pevara&apos;s family. He was beautiful, tall for his age, and fearless. He died with a knife in his hand, standing over his father&apos;s body, trying to keep the mob away from his mother. He would be long dead, with or without the Darkfriend mob, as would his great-grandchildren, but his death and the deaths of the rest of her family still haunt Pevara to this day. "}]}
