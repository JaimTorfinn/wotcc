She has actually been of the Black Ajah for all but five of her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among the Black sisters. She is now the head of the Red Ajah, and led the expedition to bring <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> to Tar Valon after he was shielded. She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at Dumai&apos;s Wells, and is now a prisoner of <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>. Galina has long black hair without a touch of gray in it. She claims to have helped break two <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin</a>&apos;s as a Black sister&#x2014;one (<a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>) was deposed and stilled, and the other (<a href='#Tamra'>Tamra Ospenya</a>) was made to appear that she had died in her sleep. She led the circle that stilled Siuan. <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a> firmly did not want to believe that Galina was Black, despite <a href='#Talene'>Talene</a>&apos;s suspicions that she was. When Galina&apos;s loyalties were proven, presumably by an inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands. Galina now serves Sevanna and often shares her tent. She is pretty, but nowhere near beautiful. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Talene'>Minly, Talene</a>; <a href='#Tamra'>Ospenya, Tamra</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna</a>; <a href='#Pevara'>Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.
