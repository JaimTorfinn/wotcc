She has raven-black hair winged with white, and is about a head taller than her husband Davram, the Marshal-General of Saldaea. She was stabbed by a man while he was ransacking her tent, but she is alive. She and Davram rarely yell, but they have a very upfront method of conversing with each other that often makes others somewhat uncomfortable. She did not approve of her daughter&apos;s marriage at first, but was eventually convinced to accept it. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Faile'>t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>; <a href='#Bashere'>Davram t&apos;Ghaline Bashere</a>.
