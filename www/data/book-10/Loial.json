            "info": "<a class='name' name='Loial'>Loial</a>, p. 85 (88)&#x2014;Son of Arent son of Halan, an Ogier from Stedding Shangtai. He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders. He is fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger. He is writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>. Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to marry him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother&apos;s choice of wives for him, <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>. In fact, the primary reason he fears returning to Stedding Shangtai is because he is convinced that his mother will insist he and Erith get married on the spot if he does, and he will not be able to finish his book. He has been traveling around to all of the <i>stedding</i> and former Ogier groves with <a href='#Karldin'>Karldin Manfor</a>, one of the Dedicated, to either seal the Waygates there or warn others to monitor them for Trolloc activity. Like most of the Ogier, he is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Erith'>Erith</a>; <a href='#Haman'>Haman, Elder</a>; <a href='#Ledar'>Ledar</a>; <a href='#Karldin'>Manfor, Karldin</a>; <a href='#Underhill'>Underhill</a>.
