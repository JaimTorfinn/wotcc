He is a very large man, which works well for work at the forge. His wife, Alsbet, is almost as large as he is, and nearly as strong. He approves of the new arrivals in Emond&apos;s Field, and has even ventured into business partnerships with some of the newcomers. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>.
