            "info": "<a class='name' name='Saerin'>Saerin Asnobar</a>, p. 40 (32)&#x2014;Sitter for the Brown Ajah in Tar Valon for forty years. She is from Altara. She carries a curved knife, in the fashion of her native Altara. She has touches of white at her dark temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar. Only a Warder could match her for scowling. She has held her chair in the Hall for forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150. Everyone knows to be wary of her temper. She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)&#x2014;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl. She is good at taking charge of things, and immediately took charge of the organization to fetter out Darkfriends in the Tower with <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara</a>, dismissing <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine</a> from her position. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Seaine'>Herimon, Seaine</a>; <a href='#Pevara'>Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.
