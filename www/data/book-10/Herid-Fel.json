He was torn limb from limb by a <i>gholam</i> for unknown reasons, although it is likely that he had stumbled upon something quite damaging to the cause of the Shadow if they would send a <i>gholam</i> to do the job. <a href='#Min'>Min</a> is currently reading his book, <i>Reason and Unreason</i>, in an attempt to better understand why he was murdered. Rand cannot make up from down in Fel&apos;s books, but Min finds them fascinating. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>. "
