He accompanied <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> on their travels because <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a> asked him to. He accepted partly out of respect for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when Liandrin used Compulsion on him, and later realized how wrong it was. He carries a notched sword-breaker and a staff with which he is deadly. He has fallen in love with <a href='#Amathera'>Amathera</a>, the Panarch of Tarabon. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amathera'>Lounault, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir</a>. "
