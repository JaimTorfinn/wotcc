            "info": "<a class='name' name='Tylin'>Tylin Quintara Mitsobar</a>, p. 110 (119)&#x2014;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara, Mistress of the Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar. Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her. She was the second from her House to sit on the throne&#x2014;this was the maximum traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell so fast from power that it could not recover. She was advised by <a href='#Merilille'>Merilille Ceandevin</a> of the Gray Ajah. She is a widow, and does not plan to marry again. However, she took an interest in <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat&apos;s usual tactic of chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>. The two were lovers for some time. When the Seanchan invaded her nation, she cooperated with them out of necessity&#x2014;they let her keep her position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne. When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city, and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain her to escape. While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the <i>gholam</i> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to it. She was found by <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a>&apos;s people the next morning, torn limb-from-limb. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>. "
