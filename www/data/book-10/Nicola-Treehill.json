She was a refugee from Ghealdan. She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see <i>ta&apos;veren</i> and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually in such language that only poets can understand it. Her potential exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, and Nynaeve. She has a limited ability to make <i>cuendillar</i>, but she is impatient in learning. She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful; she once tried to blackmail <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a>, and <a href='#Nisao'>Nisao</a>. She uses the fact that she can Foretell to be even more arrogant and demand even more special treatment. "}]}
