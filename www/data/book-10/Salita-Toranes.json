She is from Tear, has a round face, and is almost as dark as the Sea Folk. She was raised to a Sitter after the sisters banded together in Salidar. She suggested a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed through to raise money for the ever-growing army. She has been an Aes Sedai only 35 years, which is too young to be a sitter&#x2014;most sisters have worn the shawl over 100 years by the time they become Sitters. She thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from <i>cuendillar</i> that they have just made recently. She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly drawn from Healing to make the objects (as if her Ajah&apos;s duty was more important than that of other Ajahs). "
