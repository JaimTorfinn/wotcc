She succeeded <a href='#Bonwhin'>Bonwhin Meraighdin</a>, Amyrlin during the reign of <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>. Her strong spirit and sturdy administration brought the Tower back to most of its former prestige, all of which was teetering on the brink of disappearing after Bonwhin&apos;s manipulations of Hawkwing. She in effect saved the Tower. She is one of the most respected Amyrlins of all time, and part of the reason a large number of Amyrlins have been raised from the Blue Ajah. She was born in the city of Salidar, in Eharon. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elaida'>a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>; <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Bonwhin'>Meraighdin, Bonwhin</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>.
