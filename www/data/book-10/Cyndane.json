{"id":"Cyndane","name":"Cyndane","chapters":[{"title":"Epilogue: An AnswerGlossary","info":"<a class='name' name='Cyndane'>Cyndane</a>, p. 690 (834)&#x2014;Girl who works with <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>. Her name means &#x201C;Last Chance&#x201D; in the Old Tongue. She is stronger in the One Power than <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a>, but not as strong as Lanfear used to be. She is actually Lanfear reincarnated. <i>Note: It is my speculation that Lanfear was somehow weakened in the One Power after leaving the land of the Eelfinn. When <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> went there, his last wish was to get out of there; if hers was not, she may have died there, and they took both her life and some of her strength from her as a price.</i> "}]}
