He was called <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a> during his reign. He was perhaps the most strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> man in history besides <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> and <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>. His armies put down those of Guaire Amalasan, a false <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>, and he even sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, <a href='#Luthair'>Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</a>, in hopes of conquering new lands there. All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing&apos;s death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing&apos;s empire in the Old World&#x2014;they now call themselves the Seanchan. His sign was a golden hawk in flight. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Hawkwing'>Hawkwing, Artur</a>; <a href='#Luthair'>Paendrag Mondwhin, Luthair</a>. "
