            "info": "<a class='name' name='Rahvin'>Rahvin</a>, p. 691 (834)&#x2014;One of the Forsaken. He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for being a ladies&apos; man&#x2014;he always had a woman on his arm. After being released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril</a>, and used Compulsion to have <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> not only make him her advisor, but her lover as well. He eventually planned to take over the country directly as the first ever King of Andor&#x2014;he did his best to weaken support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well. Shortly after news of Morgase&apos;s death or at least abdication reached Cairhien, Rahvin was confronted and killed by <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn Rahvin&apos;s soul out of the pattern for hours, perhaps days. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>.
