            "info": "<a class='name' name='Myrelle'>Myrelle Berengari</a>, p. 398 (477)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with an elliptical face and olive skin. She is young (she has worn the shawl for about fifteen years), and known for her temper. She is now the Captain-General of the Green Ajah of the Tower-in-exile. She has four Warders named Nuhel, Croi, Avar, and most recently <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s old Warder who she is trying to save. She treats all of them as husbands in defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out. She fled the White Tower when <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> was deposed, along with most of her Ajah. She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power in Salidar despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower. She received <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s bond after <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s death, bringing her Warder count to four, at least until <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> is ready to have him as a Warder. She seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders; three of her four (Nuhel, Avar, and Lan) were previously bonded to other sisters. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>. "
