Morgase exiled her from Caemlyn as per <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>&apos;s suggestion; when Ellorien demanded to know why, Morgase had her flogged. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> was named after her grandmother. Morgase hopes she will forgive her for what she did and support her when she comes to Andor to reclaim her throne, or at least support <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> in her claim. She and her House have effectively disappeared from the face of Andoran politics for the last few weeks. "}]}
