Their goal was some day to write the complete history of the World since the Breaking, and some even before that. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> cannot tell Adeleas and Vandene apart, even though they are not twins. Adeleas was brutally murdered, along with Ispan Shefar, the Black Sister she was guarding at the time, by an unknown assassin. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> has no doubt that Adeleas&apos;s killer is one or more of <a href='#Merilille'>Merilille Ceandevin</a>, <a href='#Careane'>Careane Fransi</a>, and <a href='#Sareitha'>Sareitha Tomares</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Vandene'>Namelle, Vandene</a>.
