A Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field. While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of Mordeth in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth. Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone. Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda. It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&#x201D; from observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the hearts of men. Fain&apos;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&#x2014;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade. Fain is also called Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak officer. He is perhaps the most evil man alive. He now served for a time as advisor to <a href='#Toram'>Toram Riatin</a>, one of the Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>. Rand has a bounty of 100,000 gold crowns on his head&#x2014;Fain killed Rand&apos;s friends because they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because it was his homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it. In addition, <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin</a> is now hunting Fain, although indirectly&#x2014;he sent Isam (alias Slayer) to kill him. "
