She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored hair. She is from Shienar, and has no Warder. Lately, Delana has been causing trouble in the Hall, especially with her demands to make a formal declaration that <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> is Black Ajah. She is willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters will not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole. Her pale blue eyes give nothing away. Like many of her fellow members of the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter. Her maid is named <a href='#Halima'>Halima</a>, and she often lends her to Egwene; Halima is the only person who seems to be able to make Egwene&apos;s headaches go away. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Halima'>Saranov, Halima</a>.
