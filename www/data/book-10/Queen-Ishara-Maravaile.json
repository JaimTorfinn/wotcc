            "info": "<a class='name' name='Ishara'>Queen Ishara Maravaile</a>, p. 691 (835)&#x2014;First Queen of Andor, from whom all other queens are descended. Her husband was Souran Maravaile, one of <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>&apos;s best generals. She governed the Province of Andor until Hawkwing&apos;s empire finally fell apart and Andor became an independent nation. All of the Andoran nobles are related to her somehow, although most people would not even consider the ones who hold the closest relation to her to be related at all. None of her sons lived past age twenty, hence the tradition of only having a queen in Andor. "
