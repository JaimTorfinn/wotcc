She was considered one of the hardest-tempered Amyrlins in recent history. Her name has been the by-word of iron-handed strictness in the Tower for a hundred years. <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> worries that some day <i>her</i> name will be used to frighten novices in place of Sereille&apos;s. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Novices'>Mistress of Novices</a>.
