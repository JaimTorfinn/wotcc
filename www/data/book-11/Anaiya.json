She had blunt, motherly facial features. She was very good friends with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> both as a novice and as a full sister. She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> was raised to the Striped Stole, and carried a position of considerable influence in the &#x201C;Little Tower&#x201D; in exile from Tar Valon. She dressed very simply, and very little upset her. She was Aes Sedai for 50 or 60 years before <a href='#Kairen'>Kairen</a> came to the Tower. She was killed, along with her Warder, presumably by <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar</a>. "}]}
