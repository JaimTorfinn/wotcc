{"id":"Gaidal-Cain","name":"Gaidal Cain","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 17: A Bronze Bear","info":"<a class='name' name='Gaidal'>Gaidal Cain</a>, p. 366&#x2014;Hero of Legend bound to the Horn of Valere. He is a swordsman, and is always linked to <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a> in the stories. Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> has ever seen. Just being around him made Nynaeve uncomfortable. He and Birgitte are no longer tied to each other thanks to <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>&apos;s tearing Birgitte away from <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, and she fears she will never meet Gaidal Cain again. However, <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewings of Birgitte indicate that she has spent and will spend lifetimes with the same man&#x2014;though in some versions he is much older than she, and in others he is <i>much</i> younger&#x2014;so it appears she will find her lover again. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>.
