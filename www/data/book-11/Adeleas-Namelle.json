Their goal was some day to write the complete history of the World since the Breaking, and some even before that. <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> cannot tell Adeleas and Vandene apart, even though they are not twins. Adeleas was brutally murdered, along with <a href='#Ispan'>Ispan Shefar</a>, the Black Sister she was guarding at the time, by an unknown assassin. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> has no doubt that Adeleas&apos;s killer is either <a href='#Careane'>Careane Fransi</a> or <a href='#Sareitha'>Sareitha Tomares</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Vandene'>Namelle, Vandene</a>.
