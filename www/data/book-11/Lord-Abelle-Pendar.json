Morgase exiled him from Caemlyn as per <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>&apos;s suggestion, but she hopes he will still support her when she comes to reclaim the throne. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> hopes he will support her claim to the throne. He seems to disappear easily and at random, and for now he is effectively in hibernation from the point of view of Andoran politics. "
