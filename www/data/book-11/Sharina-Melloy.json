She has more potential than <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>. She is dignified, and has gray hair that she keeps in a tight bun at the back of her head. She ran a very large family with a very firm hand until her children (and their children) grew up. She seems to have adopted all of the novices as granddaughters, or at least as great nieces.

These tests may be based on possible future events, and the chance that Sharina became the advisor to the King of Malkier in one possible timeline is pretty good.</i> "}]}
