Aran&apos;gar was the right-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.

The other Forsaken consider Balthamel&apos;s new body a fine joke; the soul of Balthamel now occupies the body of a beautiful young woman. She still channels <i>saidin</i>, and now serves as <a href='#Delana'>Delana</a>&apos;s maid. Delana does not know that she is one of the Chosen reincarned, just that she stands far above her among the Darkfriends. Aran&apos;gar, as Balthamel, specialized in primitive cultures. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Delana'>Mosalaine, Delana</a>; <a href='#Osangar'>Osan&apos;gar</a>; <a href='#Halima'>Saranov, Halima</a>. "
