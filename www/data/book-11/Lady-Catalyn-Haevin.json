She is a dark-eyed young woman, though barely more than a girl. She pledged the support of her House to <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. She is very presumptuous and snooty, especially for someone who had not even heard of <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a> (Elayne claims that miners in Baerlon had heard Lord Bryne&apos;s name). She is somewhat plump, and <em>very</em> proud; Elayne considers her to be ungovernable. Her sign is a blue bear. "}]}
