{"id":"Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw","name":"Elmindreda (Min) Farshaw","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1: When Last Sounds","info":"<a class='name' name='Min'>Elmindreda (Min) Farshaw</a>, p. 105&#x2014;Young woman from Baerlon. She has a special ability that few besides herself know about: she sees images and auras around people, especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha&apos;man, that foretell their futures. Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when. Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included herself: he was destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which was herself. She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire. Min was in Tar Valon helping <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> with her viewings&apos; information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> from the dungeon. She accompanied the two former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for Caemlyn with Salidar&apos;s embassy to Rand. Once in Caemlyn, she brought information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions. She has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while. Min is one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon Reborn</a>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a Warder bond that she shares with the other two, <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. She is fond of reading books by the late <a href='#Fel'>Herid Fel</a>, a philosopher who worked in Rand&apos;s school of thought and was killed by a <i>gholam</i> or Slayer, presumably because he had stumbled upon information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow. She had a viewing of Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself knew.&#x2026; <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
