Morgase exiled him from Caemlyn as per <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a>&apos;s suggestion, but hoped he would still support her when she returned to claim the throne. <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> also hopes he will support <i>her</i> claim to the throne despite Morgase&apos;s actions. He leads one of the small armies that encountered <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> and her group of Aes Sedai on their way to Tar Valon. His retainers have effectively disappeared from Elayne&apos;s view, and she remains uncertain whether he will support her claim to the Lion Throne. "
