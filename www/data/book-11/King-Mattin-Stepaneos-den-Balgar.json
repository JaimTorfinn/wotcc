He has been missing since before <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> killed <a href='#Sammael'>Sammael</a>. He had no real power anyway, since Sammael ruled Illian from the Council of Nine. He was good-looking when he was younger, but he has not aged well. His beard is white, much of his hair has fallen out, his nose looks like it has been broken more than once, and his face is crushed. The cause of his disappearance has now been revealed: he was kidnapped and whisked out of Illian by <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>. "
