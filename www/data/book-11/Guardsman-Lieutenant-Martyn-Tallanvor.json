{"id":"Guardsman-Lieutenant-Martyn-Tallanvor","name":"Guardsman-Lieutenant Martyn Tallanvor","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 4: A Deal","info":"<a class='name' name='Tallanvor'>Guardsman-Lieutenant Martyn Tallanvor</a>, p. 154&#x2014;One of <a href='#Dorlain'>Maighdin</a>&apos;s companions. He is actually a tall young man from Andor who served in the Queen&apos;s Guards until <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> fled Andor. When <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> had the guards swear new oaths to the laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood will be shed before the Queen&apos;s will). He loves his queen more than his life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard. He went looking for her himself when Morgase was captured by the Shaido, and brought word back to <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> that the Seanchan were also hunting the Shaido, and an alliance might be possible.
