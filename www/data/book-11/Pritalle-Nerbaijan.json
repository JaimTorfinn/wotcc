She is friends with <a href='#Atuan'>Atuan</a>, which makes those who know about Atuan suspicious that Pritalle may also be Black. She was among those who captured <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. Pritalle did her best to avoid teaching classes, and made little effort to disguise her loathing of it when forced to teach. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Harril'>Harril</a>; <a href='#Atuan'>Larisett, Atuan</a>.
