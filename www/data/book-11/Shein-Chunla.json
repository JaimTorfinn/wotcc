She began as a strong Amyrlin, firmly in charge of the Hall and the Tower, but by the end of her reign she was a puppet, doing exactly as she was told. The Hall mishandled events itself, too, leading to one of only six mutinies in Tower history, which pulled down both Shein and the Hall. She allegedly died of natural causes, but in fact she was smothered in her bed in exile fifty-one years later after a plot was discovered to put her back on the Amyrlin Seat. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Garen'>Garen</a>.
