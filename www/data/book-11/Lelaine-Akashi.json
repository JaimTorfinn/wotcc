She was a Sitter in the White Tower for forty years until <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> was deposed. She is quite old. She now leads one of two factions that divides the Hall of the Tower under <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>. Lelaine has a <em>strong</em> desire to hold the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> herself, enough that now that Egwene has been captured she sees an opportunity to seize it. "
