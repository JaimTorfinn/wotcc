Their goal was some day to write the complete history of the World since the Breaking, and some even before that. They were both summoned back early, however, and they later came to Salidar to escape <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>&apos;s summons back to the Tower. Vandene is now in Caemlyn, and has been joy-less since Adeleas&apos;s murder. She has dedicated most of her time to finding her sister&apos;s killer. She is slender, and has white hair. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Adeleas'>Namelle, Adeleas</a>. "
