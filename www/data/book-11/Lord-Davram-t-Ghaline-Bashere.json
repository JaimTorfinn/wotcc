He is also her uncle, and <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>&apos;s father. He has black eyes, a beak-like nose, and a mustache. He is also slender, and shorter than most men; his wife towers over him. He left Saldaea with his army on an order from Tenobia to bring her the head of <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim</a> after he escaped; he ended up in Caemlyn when <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> defeated <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a>. He now commands Rand&apos;s troops in Caemlyn (those that cannot channel and are not under the command of <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> or one of the Aiel chiefs). He is feared by any potential opponents in battle, and with reason&#x2014;he is one of the best generals alive. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Faile'>t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>. "}]}
