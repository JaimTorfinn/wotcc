He considered Masema to be a harmless madman and did nothing about it, against his advisors&apos; advice. He died in an alleged hunting accident, although Uno claimed that unless Johanin did not know one end of a boar spear from another, he was killed by the nobles who told him to put the group down. He was succeeded by Ellizelle. It was Johanin who stripped <a href='#Logain'>Logain</a> of his titles when he declared himself the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. "
