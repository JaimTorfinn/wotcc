He was exiled from the Palace except for official functions by Morgase after she took the Lion Throne, but he invited himself back when <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> forced <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> out of town. He has since been exiled again by <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>. His sign is a wing and hammer. "
