            "info": "<a class='name' name='Karede'>Banner-General Furyk Karede</a>, p. 705&#x2014;Seanchan Banner-General of the Deathwatch Guards, and commander of about 2300 Seanchan troops. He is 42 years old, born to weavers, and the property of Jalid Magonine, a craftsman in Ancarid. Furyk started training for the Deathwatch Guards when he was fifteen. He was cited twice for heroism, and mentioned in dispatches three times. After seven years, after her birth, he was named to <a href='#Tuon'>Tuon</a>&apos;s personal bodyguard, though that was not her name at the time (and using that name now would be an insult to her). He was one of only three survivors of an attempt on Tuon&apos;s life, and was subsequently chosen for officer training. Later, he was injured again saving Tuon from assassins; she gave him a doll, her most prized possession at the time. Several years later, Karede was named to the <a href='#Empress'>Empress</a>&apos;s personal bodyguard, and sent with High Lord Turak and the <i>Hailene</i>. He kept Tuon&apos;s doll for over ten years until it was destroyed in the Great Fire of Sohima. He has since requested to be on Tuon&apos;s bodyguard again no fewer than three times. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tuon'>Paendrag, Tuon Athaem Kore</a>. "
