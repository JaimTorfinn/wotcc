A square-faced man, he is dark for an Andorman. During the Succession, Jared&apos;s House opposed <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>; after she became Queen, he was only allowed into the Palace on state occasions. When <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> killed <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> and took control of Caemlyn until he could find <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, Jarid tried to make himself fall into favor, thinking he could gain power with the new ruler. He and his wife have been exiled, and now support <a href='#Arymilla'>Arymilla</a>&apos;s claim to the Lion Throne, but if Elenia attempts to claim the throne for herself, Elayne expects him to assist her. He is very honorable, almost too much so. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elenia'>Sarand, Elenia</a>. "
