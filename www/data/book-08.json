She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower at its meetings. Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201D;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>&apos;s day, except for <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&#x2014;four of the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Her successor was the leader of the coup, <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, raised from the Red Ajah.

                "info": "<a class='name' name='Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, p. 23 (10)&#x2014;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> of Andor for her entire reign, and led the coup that deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&apos;s place. She distrusts anyone not of her Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not believe she will ever trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest. Her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&#x2014;this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that &#x201C;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&#x201D; The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida&apos;s Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>, Galad, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of Tigraine, Taringail, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, and a few others can match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&apos;Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders&apos; old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.

Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included herself: he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which is herself. She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire. Min was in Tar Valon helping <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> with her viewings&apos; information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> from the dungeon.

When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the name &#x201C;Mandarb&#x201D;&#x2014;she chose Faile when she found <a href='#Mandarb'>Mandarb</a> was the name of <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s horse. She fell in love with <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a> while on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found. She was shocked, but even more so to find out that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> was the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> and that both he and Perrin are <i>ta&apos;veren</i>. Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards. They were then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers. Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself. Her name means &#x201C;falcon&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewings of Perrin. She is very protective of her husband, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing so. She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like <a href='#Berelain'>Berelain</a> who eye her husband all the time. She even cornered <a href='#Min'>Min</a> when they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no intentions toward him. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>; <a href='#Bashere'>Bashere, Davram t&apos;Ghaline</a>; <a href='#Deira'>t&apos;Bashere, Deira ni Ghaline</a>.

Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the Daughter of the Nine Moons, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&#x2014;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; He currently leads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath.

Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.

It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for discovering the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or trapping two of the Forsaken as well.

She married Taringail Damodred, a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when Tigraine disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action. Taringail was Elayne&apos;s and Gawyn&apos;s father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including <a href='#Thom'>Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard; <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril</a>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase&apos;s trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne&apos;s whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.

He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair. He was raised by <a href='#Tam'>Tam al&apos;Thor</a> and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href='#Laman'>Laman</a>&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually Tigraine Damodred, the runaway <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting Ishamael. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed <a href='#Aginor'>Aginor</a> at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> to kill Be&apos;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed Ishamael in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, Lanfear confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate. His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &quot;under the forgotten symbol,&quot; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &quot;spotless tower&quot; break and bend knee to him (several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will</i> save the world&#x2014;and Break it again. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>; <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>; <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>; <a href='#Lews'>Telamon, Lews Therin</a>; <a href='#Tam'>al&apos;Thor, Tamlin</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.

This prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes Sedai during the Age of Legends. This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai&apos;tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: 1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak&apos;s collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch&apos;s Palace in Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still intact).

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.

She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam</i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam</i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a> at the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan&apos;s bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>; <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>.
