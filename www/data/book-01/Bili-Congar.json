According to <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, he is always doing stupid things and always getting hurt. She has very little, if any, respect for him. He is of an age with <a href='#Luhhan'>Haral Luhhan</a>, but he <i>looks</i> as though he is about ten years older due to his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes. Egwene encountered him with the Wisdom after he sliced open his leg due to being drunk while trying to shear sheep. It is later revealed that he does not believe in the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>, Darkfriends, Aes Sedai, or any of the other stories. He once <i>named</i> the Dark One, but when ill fortune struck his crops for months afterwards, he scowled at anyone (such as <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>) who attempted to get him to do so again. "
