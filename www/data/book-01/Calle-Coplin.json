She has not been granted the privilege of wearing her hair in a braid, the symbol of womanhood in Emond&apos;s Field, even though she is well into her twenties. She enjoys flirting, and does not seem to be bothered by the fact that many girls as many as four years her junior are considered grown women while she is not. "
