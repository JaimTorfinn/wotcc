She has short dark hair that she keeps like most boys her age do. She is slender, and barely taller than <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>.

Min has a special ability, known to few; she can see images around people that predict their future. Moiraine calls them pieces of the Pattern. She sees a lot of things around <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and his friends, but she claims that if she told Rand everything she saw about him, he would be as curly-haired as his &#x201C;friend with the shoulders.&#x201D; "}]}
