He is one of the tallest boys in Emond&apos;s Field, even taller than <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, one of his two best friends (though since Rand is not yet finished growing, it is possible he will catch Perrin eventually). He is also good friends with <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, who often gets Perrin and Rand into trouble. He has curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big. He is very shy and laughs seldomly. His parents arranged to have him apprenticed to <a href='#Luhhan'>Haral Luhhan</a>, the blacksmith of Emond&apos;s Field. Perrin has two younger sisters, <a href='#Adora'>Adora</a> and <a href='#Deselle'>Deselle</a>, and one younger brother, <a href='#Paetram'>Paetram</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Adora'>Aybara, Adora</a>; <a href='#Con'>Aybara, Con</a>; <a href='#Deselle'>Aybara, Deselle</a>; <a href='#Joslyn'>Aybara, Joslyn</a>; <a href='#Paetram'>Aybara, Paetram</a>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>; <a href='#Luhhan'>Luhhan, Haral</a>.
