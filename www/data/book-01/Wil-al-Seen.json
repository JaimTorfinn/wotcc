He is a year older than <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>. <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> thinks his ears look funny, but many of the other girls in the village think Wil is quite pretty. As a teen, he always had girls staring at him and whispering behind his back. He courted every girl, and managed to convince all of them that he was just being polite to the others. "
