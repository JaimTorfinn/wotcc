He was imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation at Shayol Ghul. This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, which led to the War of the Shadow, the Time of Madness, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age of Legends. Since naming him by his true name brings ill fortune or disaster, many euphemisms exist, including Father of Lies, Grassburner, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Leafblighter, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Sightblinder, and Soulsbane. He is most commonly referred to as simply &#x201C;The Dark One.&#x201D; <i>See also</i> <a href='#Baal'>Ba&apos;alzamon</a>; <a href='#Creator'>Creator</a>. "
