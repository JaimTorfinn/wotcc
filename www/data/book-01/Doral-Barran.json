She is white-haired and frail, though still clear-eyed and not stooped at all. Her last apprentice died of a mysterious illness that she could not cure. She mentored <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>, who recently replaced her as Wisdom. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>. "
