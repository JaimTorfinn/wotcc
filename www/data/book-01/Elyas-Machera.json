            "info": "<a class='name' name='Elyas'>Elyas Machera</a>, p. 284&#x2014;Man who lives in the woods. He has graying brown hair to his waist, held at the neck by a cord. He wears a thick beard across half his chest. He once was a Warder who taught <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a> much about the Blight and his sword. He once had to kill other Warders to get away from the Red Ajah. He cannot channel, but he <i>can</i> talk to wolves, an ability which the Red Ajah wanted to do something about anyway. His eyes are yellow, and he can communicate with wolves by way of a kind of telepathy. He lives alone, except for his wolf friends, and never expected to find another who had the same ability&#x2014;until he met <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin</a>.
