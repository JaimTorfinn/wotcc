She has been allowed to wear her hair in a braid, the Two Rivers symbol of adulthood for women, since she was sixteen years old. Berowyn was married, but her husband and her newborn child died in the epidemic of breakbone fever that struck the village; the same epidemic threatened Egwene&apos;s life as well.
