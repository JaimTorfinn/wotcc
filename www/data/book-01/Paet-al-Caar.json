Years later, he was among those that supported <a href='#Hari'>Hari Coplin</a> in his accusations that <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> brought the Trollocs to Emond&apos;s Field on Winternight. His son, <a href='#Wil'>Wil</a>, had his leg broken in that attack and was Healed by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, so Paet was less fervent in his accusations. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Wil'>al&apos;Caar, Wil</a>.
