            "info": "<a class='name' name='Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> is a shepherd from the Two Rivers. He is the tallest boy in Emond&apos;s Field. He has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of which are unheard of in the Two Rivers. His mother died when Rand was five; <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> thinks he envies boys that have mothers. Rand is good friends with <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>. As a twenty year-old, Rand is about a head taller than Perrin, and taller than Mat as well. Rand and the Mayor&apos;s daughter, Egwene, have been all but Promised to each other since they were both young; this is often the subject of ridicule by Mat and Perrin. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Kari'>al&apos;Thor, Kari</a>; <a href='#Tam'>al&apos;Thor, Tamlin</a>; <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin</a>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>.
