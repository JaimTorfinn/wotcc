She studied under <a href='#Barran'>Doral Barran</a>, the Wisdom of Emond&apos;s Field. After Mistress Barran&apos;s death, Nynaeve herself became the Wisdom. Her adult height is about as tall as <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>&apos;s shoulder. Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the Wisdom; however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the stick she carries. "
