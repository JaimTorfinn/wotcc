            "info": "<a class='name' name='Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>, p. 7 [7]&#x2014;Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field. She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite slender. She has been studying under <a href='#Barran'>Doral Barran</a>, the Wisdom of Emond&apos;s Field, for about three years. Many people in the village think she is too young to be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that Mistress Barran should have chosen someone years older when Nynaeve&apos;s predecessor died mysteriously. Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and has been allowed to braid her hair for a year now. She has developed the ability to sense <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>&apos;s presence without seeing her since the end of the breakbone fever epidemic. Mistress Barran seems to have caught on to some of Nynaeve&apos;s abilities&#x2014;she seemed disappointed that the wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem more healed than it was when she started. After Mistress Barran&apos;s death, Nynaeve herself became the Wisdom. Her adult height is about as tall as <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>&apos;s shoulder. Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the Wisdom; however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the stick she carries. "
