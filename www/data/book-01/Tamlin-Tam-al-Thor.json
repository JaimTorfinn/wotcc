He has a thick, broad chest and a broad face, gray hair with black streaks in it. His cheeks have been roughened by the sun. He is a solid man. Keeping his word is important to him. When Tam was young, he left the Two Rivers to see the outside world, something which is extremely rare in the Two Rivers. While there he acquired a sword, and married <a href='#Kari'>Kari</a>, a woman from Caemlyn. Since Kari&apos;s death fifteen years ago, Tam has raised Rand himself. Since Tam has been alone and without a wife for so long, many women in Emond&apos;s Field have been trying to find a match for him recently. They&apos;ve also started to think about who would be good for his son as well. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Kari'>al&apos;Thor, Kari</a>; <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>. "
