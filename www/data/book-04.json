This act, known as Laman&apos;s Sin, prompted three clans of the Aiel to cross the Spine of the World and avenge the death of the tree by taking his life. The tree had gift from the Aiel in gratitude for the hospitality the people of Cairhien had displayed to them in the past. It is unknown whether Laman knew of the significance of <i>Avendoraldera</i>, or of the reason the Aiel allowed the people of his kingdom to cross the Waste. The fact that he cut the tree down and brought the Aiel over the Dragonwall allowed Prophesy to be fulfilled and the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> to be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of the ancient blood (Aiel) and raised by the old (Manetheren).

His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.

He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise (and Lan&apos;s), loves him in return.
