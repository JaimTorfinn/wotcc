Traditionally, a newly raised Amyrlin grants indulgences and relief from penances on the day she is raised; Sierin granted none, and dismissed all male clerks in the Tower within a week, for various vague reasons. Three sisters were exiled from Tar Valon for a year, and two were stripped, stretched on the triangle, and birched in the Traitor&apos;s Court. She is quite plump, and has a round face that seems constructed for jolliness, but she wears grimness as though it were carved there. She is slightly taller than <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, and has hard eyes. She is merciless. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amira'>Amira</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Duhara'>Basaheen, Duhara</a>. "}]}
