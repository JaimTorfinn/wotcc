She is one of the two prettiest girls in the Accepted&apos;s quarters, and she is very aware of that fact. She always smiles when looking in a mirror, and always seems to be near to a mirror when she smiles. Waves of golden hair frame her nearly perfect face, her eyes look like large sapphires, and her skin is a rich creamy color. The only fault in her appearance, according to <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, is an over-abundance of bosom. She is very tall, as tall as most men. She is fond of telling everyone that she wants to be a Green and have six Warders. She has spiky handwriting. "
