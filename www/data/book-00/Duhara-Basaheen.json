Slim and beautiful despite being a hand and a half taller than <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>. Her full lips have a meanness about them, and her eyes search for fault. She is much weaker than <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> in the One Power, but now that she has been appointed Keeper of the Chronicles under <a href='#Sierin'>Sierin Vayu</a>, that matters little. It is tradition to appoint a Keeper from the Ajah one was raised from, but Sierin was raised from the Gray while Duhara was from the Red. However, most think of Sierin as more Red than Gray anyway. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>; <a href='#Sierin'>Vayu, Sierin</a>. "}]}
