She had two sisters and two brothers, both of which have long since passed away. She has at least two Warders, including <a href='#Karile'>Karile</a> and <a href='#Stepin'>Stepin</a>. Very tall and skinny, her hair is cut shorter than her Warders&apos; hair, above her shoulders. She does needlework when not traveling, though she rarely remains in the Tower long before leaving again. She is the strongest Aes Sedai alive except for <a href='#Meilyn'>Meilyn</a> and <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane</a>; no one has come to the Tower in over six hundred years who could match her potential. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Karile'>Karile</a>; <a href='#Stepin'>Stepin</a>.
