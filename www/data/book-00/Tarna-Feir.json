She has pale yellow hair and cold blue eyes. Tarna is very arrogant, and lacks a sense of humor entirely. She spent nine years as a novice, and gained the great serpent ring one year before <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> and <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> did. She had few friends as a novice, and has even fewer as an Accepted. "
