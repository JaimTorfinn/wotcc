By law, he must remain in the city of Chachin if <a href='#Ethenielle'>Queen Ethenielle</a> is out of the city, and she must remain there if he is abroad. He is stocky, rough-hewn, and in his middle years. He appears more suited to armor than silks, though he wears neither well. He has a strong reputation as a general, which is why he is Prince Consort, Swordbearer, and general of her armies. He is solidly built, and has green eyes. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Diryk'>Diryk</a>; <a href='#Jarene'>Jarene</a>; <a href='#Antol'>Materasu, Antol</a>; <a href='#Ethenielle'>Materasu, Ethenielle Kirukan</a>.
