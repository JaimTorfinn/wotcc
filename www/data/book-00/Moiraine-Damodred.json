She grew up in the Sun Palace in Cairhien, a niece of <a href='#Laman'>Laman</a>, King of Cairhien, and half-sister of <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a>, the husband of the Queen of Andor. Upon entering the White Tower, she quickly formed a friendship with <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, daughter of a Tairen fisherman. The two have been progressing at nearly identical paces ever since. Moiraine is <i>very</i> short&#x2014;short even for a Cairhienin woman&#x2014;and has very pale skin. She has been known to flash her temper on occasion. Both of her parents are dead; her mother died when she was very young. Like her friend Siuan, she was born with the spark of <i>saidar</i> in her. She will some day become one of the strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower. Moiraine has great respect and admiration for <a href='#Tamra'>Tamra Ospenya</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Cormanes'>Cormanes</a>; <a href='#Aldecain'>Damodred, Aldecain</a>; <a href='#Anvaere'>Damodred, Anvaere</a>; <a href='#Carewin'>Damodred, Carewin</a>; <a href='#Innloine'>Damodred, Innloine</a>; <a href='#Laman'>Damodred, Laman</a>; <a href='#Moressin'>Damodred, Moressin</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>.
