He came to Emond&apos;s Field on Winternight, and left with <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>, and <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> on their journey. He saved Rand&apos;s life by facing a Myrddraal long enough for Rand to escape, and is presumed to be dead at the hands of that Myrddraal. However, Moiraine believes him to be alive, and one of his friends once remarked that he would believe Thom dead when he saw his corpse. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Owyn'>Merrilin, Owyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
