He led the armies of the Light during the War of the Shadow, as well as the stroke that re-sealed the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s prison. He is believed to be the strongest Aes Sedai of all time, as well as the most strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> individual in recorded history. His banner was a white field with a four-footed serpentine creature (a dragon) on it. This banner was given to <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> after it was discovered that he was the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Unfortunately, Lews Therin went mad along with the rest of the Hundred Companions, finally killing his wife, children, and everyone he loved. He was thus given the name <a href='#Kinslayer'>Kinslayer</a>, and his name is now associated with evil in the eyes of many. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#Kinslayer'>Kinslayer</a>.
