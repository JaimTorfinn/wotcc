While he was staying with <a href='#Elyas'>Elyas Machera</a>, he found that he has the ability to talk to wolves. Once this ability manifested itself, his eyes took on the yellowish color of wolves&apos; eyes. He is bigger than most people, a fact which greatly helped him as a blacksmith&apos;s apprentice, but the fact that he often underestimates his strength has caused him to be very cautious. He carries a large battle ax at his belt. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>; <a href='#Bull'>Young Bull</a>. "
