Galad always does what he thinks is right, even if it would hurt his family and friends. He has extreme skill with a sword, learning everything the Warders teach him after one demonstration. He is strikingly handsome, even more so than his half-brother Gawyn. Like Gawyn, he has a crush on <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, but she does not return his feelings the way she does Gawyn&apos;s. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
