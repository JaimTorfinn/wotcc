Perhaps her strongest Foretelling occurred in front of <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> and <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine Damodred</a> (then Accepted) in the Amyrlin&apos;s chamber when she Foretold the birth of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. She died immediately after this Foretelling. It is due to Gitara that both Moiraine and Siuan chose the Blue Ajah and dedicated their lives to finding the boy who would grow up to become the Dragon Reborn. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Tigraine'>Damodred, Tigraine</a>; <a href='#Luc'>Mantear, Luc</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>.
