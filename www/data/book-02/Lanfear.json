She is believed to be the second most powerful of the Forsaken, second only to <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, who were given their names by those they betrayed, Lanfear chose her name herself&#x2014;in the Old Tongue, &#x201C;Daughter of the Night.&#x201D; Besides her name, the only thing known about her for certain is that before she went over to the Shadow, she was the lover of <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>. She sees <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and Lews Therin to be the same person, and is thus very protective of Rand.\n"
