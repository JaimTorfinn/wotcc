She is one of only three Aes Sedai who knows that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> is the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>, the other two being <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>. Verin is old, even for an Aes Sedai, but the only indication that she is as old as she is is the slight tinge of gray in her hair. She is one of the Aes Sedai outside the Amyrlin&apos;s chambers when <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> is summoned. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tomas'>Tomas</a>. "
