When he and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named Elyas Machera. Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself. Perrin&apos;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&apos; eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them. Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&apos;veren</i> <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>. On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of <a href='#Zarine'>Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a> (which means &quot;Falcon&quot; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn. The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man&#x2014;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helps considerably when helping Master Luhhan on his forge, but sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He is currently in the Two Rivers, helping to rebuild the area after the series of Trolloc attacks. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Faile'>t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>; <a href='#Zarine'>Bashere, Zarine</a>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>.
