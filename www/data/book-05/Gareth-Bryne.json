He was appointed to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase&apos;s new advisor, <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril</a>. He now lives on his private estates in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who unintentionally burned a barn: <a href='#Mara'>Mara Tomanes</a>, <a href='#Amaena'>Amaena</a>, and <a href='#Serenla'>Serenla</a>. When these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer curiosity. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Leane'>Sharif, Leane</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
