Her name is that of a spider that lived during the Age of Legends&#x2014;those spiders spun webs in non-obvious places, and their bites killed in seconds. She always attacks from safety, if at all possible. While Moghedien was in Tanchico, she was bested in a proverbial wrestling match (with <i>saidar</i> instead of muscles) by <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>. She managed to escape because Nynaeve did not know that tied off shields could be defeated, and vows to have revenge. "}]}
