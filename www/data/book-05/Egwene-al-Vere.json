She has considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. It is also thought that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she is currently in training with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and don&apos;t really want to.
