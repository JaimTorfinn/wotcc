The Tree was severely damaged when <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean</a> battled over control of the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> statue and destroyed the shielding on Rhuidean, but it is still alive and will send out shoots again. A cutling of the Tree was given to the people of Cairhien as a sign of goodwill from the Aiel over 500 years ago. That Tree, <i><a href='#Avendo'>Avendoraldera</a></i>, grew in the center of the city of Cairhien until <a href='#Laman'>King Laman Damodred</a> cut it down to make a throne out of the wood. Laman&apos;s Sin (as it is now called) brought four Aiel clans over the Spine of the World to kill Laman for killing the Tree. <i>See also</i> <i><a href='#Avendo'>Avendoraldera</a></i>; <a href='#Laman'>Damodred, Laman</a>.
