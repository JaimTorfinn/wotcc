She is the mother of <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>. She married <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of Cairhien, Elayne and Gawyn&apos;s father; he died when they were young. She has since gone through several lovers, including <a href='#Thom'>Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard; <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril</a>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase&apos;s trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne&apos;s whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril seems to be usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a> of the Red Ajah, who is now the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elaida'>a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>; <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
