She grew up in Arad Doman. She has coppery skin and a swan-like neck, and is fond of thin, clinging dresses. This figure and taste is similar to how <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> acts, dresses, and looks, and is typical of a Domani woman. When in Tanchico, Jeaine tried to kill <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> with the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that produces balefire. <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> refuses to believe that she even <i>saw</i> Nynaeve there, much less attacked her.
