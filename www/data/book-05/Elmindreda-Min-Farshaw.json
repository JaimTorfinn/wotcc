She has a special ability that few besides herself know about: she sees images and auras around people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their futures. Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when. Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included herself: three different women are destined to fall in love with him, one of which is herself. She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. She worked in the Tower so <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> could have her and her viewings close by; she eventually helped Siuan and <a href='#Leane'>Leane</a> get free from their cell as well. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Chalinda'>Chalinda</a>; <a href='#Serenla'>Min, Serenla</a>.
