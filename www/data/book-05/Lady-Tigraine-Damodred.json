She was the <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir</a> to the Throne of Andor and daughter of <a href='#Mordrellen'>Queen Mordrellen</a>, but she disappeared. Her disappearance set of the Third War of Andoran Succession. When <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> was in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, several people commented on his striking resemblance to Tigraine; this is no coincidence, since Tigraine is Rand&apos;s mother. She fled to the Aiel Waste upon warning from <a href='#Gitara'>Gitara Moroso</a> to become a Maiden of the Spear, and gave birth to Rand when the Aiel were fighting near Tar Valon. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mordrellen'>Mantear, Mordrellen</a>.
