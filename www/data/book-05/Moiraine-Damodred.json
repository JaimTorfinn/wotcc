Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a>&apos;s youngest half-sister, and <a href='#Laman'>King Laman</a>&apos;s niece. She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai. Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed <a href='#Gitara'>Gitara Moroso</a>&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>. Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.

When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met <a href='#Lan'>Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight and the Borderlands; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted. She is very strong in the Power. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>; <a href='#Gitara'>Moroso, Gitara</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>.
