Her name means &#x201C;Daughter of the Night&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose the name herself. She was the second strongest of the Forsaken (after <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>). Before she turned to the Shadow, before <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> met <a href='#Ilyena'>Ilyena</a> (who Lanfear despises), she was his lover. She now plans to reclaim &#x201C;her&#x201D; man, <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, even though he is a different person.... She is as beautiful as <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> is handsome, and even <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal</a> just looks pretty next to her. She has dark eyes and dark hair. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mierin'>Eronaile, Mierin</a>; <a href='#Keille'>Shaogi, Keille</a>. "}]}
