He is a swordsman, and is always linked to <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a> in the stories. Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> has ever seen. Just being around him makes Nynaeve uncomfortable. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>. "
