He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the end of the War of the Shadow to the present. He took credit for such things as convincing the then insane <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a> to refuse the Aes Sedai Healing that might have saved his life, and many other events in history that turned out poorly. When the rest of the Forsaken were freed, Ishamael kept them away from eachother&apos;s throats. He confronted <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s bonds; he confronted him again at Falme, where Rand melted his sword when he put it through him, but not after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took <i>Callandor</i>, after which Rand killed him by plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart. His body rotted quickly, but it was proof that Ba&apos;alzamon, which he called himself to the public, was a human being, and not the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Baal'>Ba&apos;alzamon</a>; <a href='#Dark'>Shai&apos;tan</a>.
