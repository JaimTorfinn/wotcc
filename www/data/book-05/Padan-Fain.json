            "info": "<a class='name' name='Fain'>Padan Fain</a>, p. 24 (20)&#x2014;Former peddler who frequently came to Emond&apos;s Field. A Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field. While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of <a href='#Mordeth'>Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth. Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone. Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda. It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&#x201D; from observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the hearts of men. Fain&apos;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&#x2014;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade. <i>Machin Shin</i>, the Black Wind of the Ways which is perfectly alright with consuming Trollocs alive, did not consume Fain&apos;s soul, instead welcoming him as an old friend. Fain is also called <a href='#Ordeith'>Ordeith</a>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak officer. He is perhaps the most evil and dangerous man alive. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Mordeth'>Mordeth</a>; <a href='#Ordeith'>Ordeith</a>. "
