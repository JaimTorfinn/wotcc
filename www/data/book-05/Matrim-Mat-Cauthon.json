He is <i>ta&apos;veren</i>. Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attack on Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named <a href='#Melindhra'>Melindhra</a>, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn. He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him; this was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; <i>See also</i> <a href='#Nynaeve'>al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>; <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin</a>; <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>; <a href='#Melindhra'>Melindhra</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
