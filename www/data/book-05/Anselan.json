He was a Warder chosen by the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> of the time for <a href='#Barashelle'>Barashelle</a>. Barashelle had bonded a Warder as an Accepted; this was strictly forbidden, even though she was to be raised to the shawl the next day. She bonded him then to make sure that another Accepted, who was being raised one day earlier than she, did not bond him first. The Amyrlin made her transfer his bond to another woman, and forced her to bond Anselan. Anselan was cold to her, and she spent most of her life trying to make him see her with respect. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Barashelle'>Barashelle</a>. "
