He is fiercely loyal to <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>, and when <a href='#Gaebril'>Gaebril</a> made the guards swear a new oath, he swore it only so long as it took before he could re-swear the old one, which was to serve the Queen, not the Law. He bears no liking for Gaebril, and tries to convince Morgase to leave him. He seems to love his queen not only as a queen, but as a woman&#x2014;he is very passionate about serving his queen. "
