Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks. He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread from Thom to <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and <a href='#Min'>Min</a>. Thom was originally a bard in <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal Court, and for a time after her husband <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the Queen&apos;s lover. During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of it. Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do. He accompanied <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> on their travels as per <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s request, despite the fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
