She gives her full name to <a href='#Faolain'>Faolain</a> in hopes that the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin</a> will be the only one to recognize it and know who she is&#x2014;the name is actually out of a story, and the character who her mother took it from spent most of her time sighing at men. It is also the name Min assumes while in the Tower to make certain people do not learn her true identity. Min has a special ability that few besides herself know about: she sees images and auras around people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that Foretell their futures. Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when. Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included herself: three different women are destined to fall in love with him, one of which is herself. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>.
