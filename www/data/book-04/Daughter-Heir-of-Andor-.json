No man is allowed to be King, at least not as more than a figurehead. The previous Daughter-Heir, Tigraine, disappeared over twenty years ago; the current Daughter-Heir is <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>. It is also traditional for the Daughter-Heir and her oldest brother (who will become First Prince of the Sword when she becomes Queen) to train in Tar Valon, but Elayne is the first Daughter Heir, indeed, the first ruler of any kind in recent memory, to actually have enough ability to channel that she will become Aes Sedai. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.
