She accompanied <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, and <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> back to the Tower from Falme. Unlike most Browns, Verin seems to be actively involved in the world outside the Tower library, and is much less disconnected than most of her Brown cohorts. She garners a small measure of trust from <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>, who feels she has no choice but to trust Verin given what she knows: she is one of only two Aes Sedai (the others being Siuan herself and <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>) that knew the truth that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> was the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> before he fought in the sky above Falme and declared himself in the Stone of Tear. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Tomas'>Tomas</a>.
