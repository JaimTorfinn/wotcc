He commands the army of Whitecloaks that are stationed at Watch Hill in the Two Rivers. He is determined to find <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, the man who he believes led his father to his death (he also thinks Perrin is a Darkfriend). Dain has a hatred for those who killed his father, and like most of the Whitecloaks he is convinced that it was Aes Sedai who beat them at Falme (i.e., the Seanchan are just a story engineered by Darkfriends to hide their actions). He vows to avenge his father&apos;s death. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Bornhald'>Bornhald, Geofram</a>; <a href='#Byar'>Byar, Jaret</a>; <a href='#Valda'>Valda, Eamon</a>. "}]}
