When Egeanin found her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <i>a&apos;dam</i> she was carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the <i>a&apos;dam</i> should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring around her head). Much to Egeanin&apos;s and Bethamin&apos;s surprise, the <i>a&apos;dam</i> held Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> it was intended for. From this, and from <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>&apos;s information about the possibility of learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that all <i>sul&apos;dam</i>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were taught&#x2014;which went against everything she had been taught her entire life.
