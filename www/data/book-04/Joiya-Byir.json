She is the oldest of the Black sisters who left the Tower with <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>, old enough to be the grandmother of the girls who are hunting her. <i>Note: in the original edition, Joiya was listed as White Ajah, but I have been told that this was changed to Gray in later editions. I have left it as White here.</i> "}]}
