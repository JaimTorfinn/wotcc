When he and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named <a href='#Elyas'>Elyas Machera</a>. Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself. Perrin&apos;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&apos; eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them. Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&apos;veren</i> <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>. On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of <a href='#Zarine'>Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a> (which means &#x201C;Falcon&#x201D; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a hunter for the horn. The two have grown to love each other. Perrin is a very large man&#x2014;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helped considerably when helping <a href='#Luhhan'>Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Adora'>Aybara, Adora</a>; <a href='#Carlin'>Aybara, Carlin</a>; <a href='#Con'>Aybara, Con</a>; <a href='#Deselle'>Aybara, Deselle</a>; <a href='#Ealsin'>Aybara, Ealsin</a>; <a href='#Eward'>Aybara, Eward</a>; <a href='#Neain'>Aybara, Neain</a>; <a href='#Faile'>Bashere, Faile</a>; <a href='#Zarine'>Bashere, Zarine</a>; <a href='#Cilia'>Cole, Cilia</a>.
