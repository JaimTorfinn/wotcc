She served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase of Andor</a>, a position she sought after she had a Foretelling about the importance of the Royal Family of Andor. Elaida is the only Aes Sedai alive to have any real strength in the Fortelling&#x2014;the last Aes Sedai to actually have regular Foretellings was <a href='#Gitara'>Gitara Moroso</a>, now dead over twenty years. Elaida keeps her own agenda, and is very suspicious (as all Reds are) of Blue Ajah activities, especially those of <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> (Elaida still considers the Amyrlin to be of the Blue Ajah, not of&#xA0; &#x201C;all Ajahs and none&#x201D;). Elaida&apos;s Foretelling about the importance of the Andoran Royal Family occurred during the Third War of Andoran Succession, after which Morgase took the throne. Thus, her Foretelling might have, and most likely <i>did</i>, refer to the then current Royal Family, that of Tigraine, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail</a>, Luc, and <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
