            "info": "<a class='name' name='Loial'>Loial</a>, p. 56 (40)&#x2014;Ogier from Stedding Shangtai, son of <a href='#Arent'>Arent</a> son of <a href='#Halan'>Halan</a>. He is fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger. He is writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>. Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to marry him off and settle him down; he is only ninety years old, which by Ogier standards is not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> by himself. Loial is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier&#x2014;and horrified that some see him and think he is a Trolloc. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Arent'>Arent</a>; <a href='#Halan'>Halan</a>. "
