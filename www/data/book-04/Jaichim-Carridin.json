He frequents the Garden of Silver Breezes, an inn in Tanchico, and is the only man <a href='#Selindrin'>Selindrin</a> allows to enter the inn armed. Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend. He was given orders (under the name <a href='#Bors'>Bors</a>) by <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a> to find and kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead. So far, Carridin has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest sister <a href='#Dealda'>Dealda</a> (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade). He expects his sister, <a href='#Vanora'>Vanora</a>, to be next. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Bors'>Bors</a>; <a href='#Dealda'>ni Carridin, Dealda</a>; <a href='#Vanora'>Carridin, Vanora</a>. "}]}
