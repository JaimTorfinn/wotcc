In that vision, he never smiled. In later viewings, Lewin was the man who violated the Way of the Leaf by killing the men who kidnapped his family and would have killed him. All of the Aiel (with the exception of the Jenn) are most likely descendants of him and the other boys with him; they will never touch a sword (since a sword can only be used to kill a man), but since Lewin killed with a spear, the Aiel prefer spears as their primary weapons. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Adan'>Adan</a>; <a href='#Maigran'>Maigran</a>; <a href='#Saralin'>Saralin</a>.
