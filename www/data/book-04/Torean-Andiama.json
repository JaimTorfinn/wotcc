He has white hair streaking his black beard. Right after Rand received his injury from the &#x201C;bubble of evil,&#x201D; he was having an argument with Torean, after which Rand picked up Torean and flung him out of the room. He is the wealthiest of the High Lords of Tear. Later, Rand charges Torean with financing his war campaign, since Torean has all the funding for it. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Estean'>Andiama, Estean</a>. "
