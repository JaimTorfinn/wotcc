He has a massive crush on <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, but although she is flattered and embarrased, she does not return his affection. Her real affection is for his half-brother Gawyn. Galad is virtuous to the point of fault (in Elayne&apos;s eyes, at least)&#x2014;he will do whatever he thinks is right, regardless of who is hurt by his actions, including himself or his friends. He is strikingly handsome, and even Aes Sedai sit and watch him for hours while he practices the sword for the sole reason of looking at him. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
