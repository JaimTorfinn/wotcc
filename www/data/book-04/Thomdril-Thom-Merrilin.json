{"id":"Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin","name":"Thomdril (Thom) Merrilin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 2: Whirlpools in the Pattern","info":"<a class='name' name='Thom'>Thomdril (Thom) Merrilin</a>, p. 57 (41)&#x2014;A gleeman who came to Emond&apos;s Field on Winternight when the Trollocs came. <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> thinks him to be quite the ladies&apos; man, which is fairly accurate. Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks. He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread from Thom to <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> and <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>. Thom was originally a bard in <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal Court, and for a time after her husband <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the Queen&apos;s lover. During his fight with a Fade near Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of it. Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Owyn'>Merrilin, Owyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
