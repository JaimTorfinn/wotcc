{"id":"Nynaeve-al-Meara","name":"Nynaeve al'Meara","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1: Seeds of Shadow","info":"<a class='name' name='Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>, p. 22 (9)&#x2014;A young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now one of the Accepted. She has exceptional potential, and will most likely be the most powerful Aes Sedai since the Age of Legends. However, Nynaeve&apos;s channeling is obstructed due to the fact that she had to learn to control her ability herself without really knowing what she was controlling: she is a wilder. She can only touch the True Source when she is extremely angry (thereby letting her guard down and circumventing her block). Along with <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, Nynaeve is one of three people <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> trusts in the Tower; Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot possibly be Darkfriends. She sent them on a dangerous mission: spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them, and see if they can catch them in the process. Nynaeve has developed feelings for <a href='#Lan'>Lan Mandragoran</a>, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s Warder, and he shares those feelings despite his insistence that it is inappropriate and dangerous to act on them. Nynaeve blames Moiraine herself for disrupting her village&apos;s life and endangering the lives of the four people she spirited away when the Trollocs attacked Emond&apos;s Field. She wishes to learn how to control her ability so she can get even&#x2014;to put Moiraine in her place, as it were&#x2014;and to study and perfect the art of Healing. She is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the battle with <a href='#Belal'>Be&apos;lal</a> and the taking of the Stone. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
