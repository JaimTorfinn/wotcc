{"id":"Liandrin","name":"Liandrin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 5: Questioners","info":"<a class='name' name='Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>, p. 115 (95)&#x2014;Leader of the group of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process. She is one of three Black sisters that <a href='#Amico'>Amico</a> knew of before leaving the Tower. She has a face like a doll. Liandrin was Red Ajah before turning Black, but her oath to the Black was sworn only days (perhaps hours) after her raising to the shawl, so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at all. Her father sold fruit on the street. "}]}
