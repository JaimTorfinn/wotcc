She is a <i>sul&apos;dam</i>, and has been raised to a Voice of the Blood. No other <i>sul&apos;dam</i> has ever been raised to the Blood before, much less to a Voice of the Blood, but Alwhin knows too much to be a simple <i>sul&apos;dam</i>: she knows that <i>sul&apos;dam</i> can be controlled via <i>a&apos;dam</i>. She was intended to hold <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>&apos;s leash when the Seanchan attempted to collar her outside the Ways with <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>&apos;s assistance. "
