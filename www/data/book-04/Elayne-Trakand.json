{"id":"Elayne-Trakand","name":"Elayne Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1: Seeds of Shadow","info":"<a class='name' name='Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, p. 22 (9)&#x2014;The <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, the only daughter of <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> and her late husband <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a>. She is sister to <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a> and half-sister to <a href='#Galad'>Galad</a>. Elayne is now one of the Accepted, and has considerable potential in the One Power; she may become stronger than any living Aes Sedai save her two friends, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>. Elayne, along with Egwene and Nynaeve, is one of the only people <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> trusts in the Tower; Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot possibly be Darkfriends. She did not, however, send Elayne on the mission she gave the other two so as not to anger Morgase any more than she already had. Elayne still chose, of her own volition, to accompany her friends on their dangerous mission: spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them, and see if they can catch them in the process. Elayne is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the battle with <a href='#Belal'>Be&apos;lal</a> and the taking of the Stone. Her sign is a golden lily. <i>Editor&apos;s Note: In Chapter 8, we find that Elayne has the ability to channel </i>saidin<i> as well as </i>saidar<i>. This is likely a typo, however.</i> <i>See also</i> <a href='#Galad'>Damodred, Galadedrid</a>; <a href='#Taringail'>Damodred, Taringail</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
