She has long dark hair and dark eyes. While on her quest to hunt for the Horn, she encountered <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>, and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a> when they were persuing <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> to Tear. She was shocked to find out that the Horn of Valere had already been <i>used</i>, much less found, and even more surprised that Rand was the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. When she found this information out, Moiraine forbade her to leave them, since if she did she could upset the balance of the world by telling the wrong person that the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a> was Reborn. Faile eventually developed feelings for Perrin, feelings which he found he returned. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Bashere'>Bashere, Davram t&apos;Ghaline</a>; <a href='#Maedin'>Bashere, Maedin</a>; <a href='#Zarine'>Bashere, Zarine</a>.
