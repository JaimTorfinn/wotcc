He was the most powerful of all the Forsaken, and leader of the Shadow&apos;s forces. <a href='#Alnora'>Alnora</a> believed, correctly, that he was not completely trapped in the sealing on the Bore. Ishamael masterminded many of the subtle plots that the Shadow used over the years&#x2014;he also claims to have convinced the then insane <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> to kill everyone he loved. Due to his barely being trapped in the Bore, his sanity was not completely intact for the 3000 years since the Breaking of the World; he allowed others to believe that he was the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>, and it is not known whether <i>he</i> believed that he was or not. He was killed by <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> in the Stone of Tear, right after <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> killed <a href='#Belal'>Be&apos;lal</a> and Rand drew <i>Callandor</i>. His body was quickly taken by decay, but it <i>was</i> a human body (with the eyes burned away). <i>See also</i> <a href='#Baal'>Ba&apos;alzamon</a>. "
