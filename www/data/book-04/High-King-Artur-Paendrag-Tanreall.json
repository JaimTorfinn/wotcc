He was perhaps the most strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> man in history besides <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> and <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>. His armies put down those of <a href='#Guaire'>Guaire Amalasan</a>, a false Dragon, and he even sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, <a href='#Luthair'>Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</a>, in hopes of conquering new lands there. All contact with these armies was lost at his death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of his empire in the Old World&#x2014;they now call themselves the Seanchan. He was known as <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a> during most of his reign. His sign was a hawk in flight. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Hawkwing'>Hawkwing, Artur</a>; <a href='#Luthair'>Paendrag Mondwhin, Luthair</a>. "}]}
