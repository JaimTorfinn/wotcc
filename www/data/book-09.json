Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201D;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>&apos;s day, except for <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&#x2014;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the Keeper of the Chronicles, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Her successor was the leader of the coup, <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, raised from the Red Ajah.

Aviendha is one of the three women in <a href='#Min'>Min</a>&apos;s viewing of Rand&#x2014;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as &#x201C;wetlanders&#x201D; did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i> sister-wife in Min, but she is determined to meet her before passing any judgment. She has recently been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of unraveling weaves&#x2014;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have plans to adopt each other as first-sisters. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Amys'>Amys</a>; <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>; <a href='#Shyanda'>Shyanda</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>.

At the moment of Creation, Shai&apos;tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul. This prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes Sedai during the Age of Legends. This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai&apos;tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: 1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of <a href='#Domon'>Bayle Domon</a>, later pilfered by <a href='#Turak'>High Lord Turak</a> of the Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak&apos;s collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch&apos;s Palace in Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still intact).

She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. As a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a> of Andor for her entire reign, and led the coup that deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&apos;s place. She distrusts anyone not of her Ajah (as most Reds do), and doesn&apos;t believe she will ever trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest. Her Keeper of the Chronicles is <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&#x2014;this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that &#x201C;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&#x201D; The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida&apos;s Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>, Galad, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of Tigraine, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&apos;Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders&apos; old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Alviarin'>Freidhen, Alviarin</a>; <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.

It is the name of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain&apos;s mind. Mordeth became a counsellor in Aridhol during the Trolloc Wars. He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel. Slowly it became so, until finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark. The city finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand, every rock, every sip of water with its hatred. Mordeth&apos;s soul remained in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (&quot;Where the Shadow Waits&quot;) for millenia&#x2014;he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to the outside world. Strangely enough, both of these things happened at the same time, when <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a> carried the ruby-handled dagger from the city while <a href='#Fain'>Padan Fain</a> accompanied Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.

In Fain&apos;s case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely successful&#x2014;instead, the two souls merged to create something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone. Fain now feels incomplete without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.

Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for herself, which means &#x201C;Daughter of the Night&#x201D; in the Old Tongue. She was born Mierin Eronaile, and was very strong in the One Power. She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary facility for research into the One Power. Her final discovery there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed by men and women alike&#x2014;this source turned out to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s prison. She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him. Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married <a href='#Ilyena'>Ilyena Moerelle</a>, she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her. She declared as her territory the World of Dreams, <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown. She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin&apos;s soul&apos;s new body, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore. She first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman. Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been &#x201C;unfaithful&#x201D; to her, and she tried to kill him.

He was appointed to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase&apos;s new advisor, <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril</a>. He moved to his private estates in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, the former <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; Leane Sharif, the former Keeper of the Chronicles, and <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw</a>. When these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer curiosity to Salidar. Once there, he discovered the true identity of the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken. The Aes Sedai in Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the Amyrlin Seat from <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>, since he was the only commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help them. He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel Waste, in a league with <a href='#Niall'>Pedron Niall</a>, Rodel Ituralde, <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, Agelmar Jagad, and <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon</a>. Although neither of them would admit it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to avoid another mistake like his relationship as <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a>&apos;s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for when she publicly shamed him years ago. She seems to be developing similar feelings for him, much to her dismay. He plans to be the first ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever came was with <a href='#Guaire'>Guaire Amalasan</a>&apos;s armies, who got as far as the White Tower itself, and <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city. Actually, Amalasan&apos;s troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships coming up the river. Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this problem. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Siuan'>Sanche, Siuan</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>. "

He will become First Prince of the Sword when Elayne becomes Queen. He and his half-brother Galad went to train with the Warders in the White Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess considerable skill with the sword. During the chaos that erupted after <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>&apos;s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and Leane from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters&#x2014;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support&#x2014;he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a> and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader. He believes the rumor that <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside the Tower, just by leading the Younglings. He detests Rand because he thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no telling how he will react when he finds out that Elayne loves him, as well as that Egwene heads the rebellion against the Tower. His sign is a white boar. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>. "

Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and <a href='#Bode'>Bodewhin</a>, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&#x2014;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; He currently leads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there he was cornered by <a href='#Tylin'>Queen Tylin</a>, who gave him little choice but to become her lover. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>; <a href='#Bode'>Cauthon, Bodewhin</a>; <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>.

It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for discovering the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or trapping two of the Forsaken as well.

Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.

He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair. He was raised by Tam al&apos;Thor and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish Laman&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually Tigraine Damodred, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw</a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>. Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> to kill Be&apos;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a> confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and Asmodean, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate. His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &#x201C;under the forgotten symbol,&#x201D; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He has also been bonded by <a href='#Alanna'>Alanna Mosvani</a>, an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah, against his will&#x2014;the first such bonding in hundreds of years. He plans to use the Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa&apos;angreal</i> created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>&apos;s taint from <i>saidin</i>. He plans to do it soon, to prevent further problems with his Asha&apos;man, men who came for his &#x201C;amnesty&#x201D; against male channelers, going mad. He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will</i> save the world&#x2014;and Break it again. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Elaida'>a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>; <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>; <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>; <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i>; <a href='#Mat'>Cauthon, Matrim</a>; <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon, The</a>; <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>; <a href='#Min'>Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>; <a href='#Cadsuane'>Melaidhrin, Cadsuane</a>; <a href='#Alanna'>Mosvani, Alanna</a>; <a href='#Lews'>Telamon, Lews Therin</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>.

She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to date.

He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin</a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan&apos;s status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan&apos;s favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she leads. According to the Wise Ones, <i><a href='#Aan'>Aan&apos;allein</a></i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not <i>the</i> best, warriors in the World. <i>See also</i> <i><a href='#Aan'>Aan&apos;allein</a></i>; <a href='#Myrelle'>Berengari, Myrelle</a>; <a href='#Moiraine'>Damodred, Moiraine</a>; <a href='#Nynaeve'>ti al&apos;Meara Mandragoran, Nynaeve</a>.

She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam</i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam</i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle</a> the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan&apos;s bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. As Lan&apos;s wife, she will become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight. She now wears the <i>ki&apos;sain</i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&#x2014;Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in <i>tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Egwene'>al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>; <a href='#Myrelle'>Berengari, Myrelle</a>; <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
