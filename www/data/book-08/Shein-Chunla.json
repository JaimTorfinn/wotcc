She was raised from the Green Ajah. She squandered the power of the Amyrlin and was actually deposed and exiled, although the story in public was that she died in office. Four plots attempted to restore her to the Amyrlin Seat; after the fourth, she was smothered in her sleep with a pillow by the sisters guarding her. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Gerra'>Kishar, Gerra</a>.
