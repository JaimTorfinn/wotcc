{"id":"Jaichim-Carridin","name":"Jaichim Carridin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 28: Crimsonthorn","info":"<a class='name' name='Carridin'>Jaichim Carridin</a>, p. 553 (630)&#x2014;Inquisitor for the Hand of the Light, better known as the Questioners; he aspires to some day become High Inquisitor, perhaps even Lord Captain Commander. Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend. He was given orders (under the name Bors) by Ishamael to find and kill <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead. So far, Carridin has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest sister Dealda (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade). His older sister, Vanora, recently met with a similar fate. He himself was killed by <a href='#Shiaine'>Shiaine</a> by drowning with brandy. "}]}
