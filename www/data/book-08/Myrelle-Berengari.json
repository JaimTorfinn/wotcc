            "info": "<a class='name' name='Myrelle'>Myrelle Berengari</a>, p. 319 (357)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with an elliptical face. She is young (she has worn the shawl for about fifteen years), and has four Warders named Nuhel, Croi, Avar, and most recently <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s old Warder, whom she is trying to save. She treats all of them as husbands in defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out. She fled the White Tower when <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan</a> was deposed, along with most of her Ajah. She is one of the six sisters who hold much of the power in Salidar despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower. She received <a href='#Lan'>Lan</a>&apos;s bond after <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s death, bringing her Warder count to four, at least until <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> is ready to have him as a Warder. She seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders; three of her four (Nuhel, Avar, and Lan) were previously bonded to other sisters. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Lan'>Mandragoran, Lan</a>. "
