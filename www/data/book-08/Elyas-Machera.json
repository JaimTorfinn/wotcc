Elyas was a Warder at one time, and left the Tower when he discoverd that he could talk to wolves. He did not find any problem with the ability by itself, but felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who thought they should gentle him (even though there was nothing to be gentled) because of his ability. Elyas helped Perrin learn that he could talk to wolves as well; Perrin does not necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over the dislike of it as well. Elyas heard about Perrin through the wolves, and came to meet him to assist him in his quest. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Perrin'>Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>. "
