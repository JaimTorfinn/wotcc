            "info": "<a class='name' name='Liandrin'>Liandrin</a>, p. 460 (521)&#x2014;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Red. She has light hair and a face like a doll. She grew up in Tarabon. She led the group of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process. Liandrin was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came to the Tower), so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at all. When she attempted to Compel <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>, she was flogged with the Power and then shielded so she could effectively never channel again. She is now <i>da&apos;covale</i>, a slave to <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth</a>. "
