His name means &#x201C;Death&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name more. He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have already appeared in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the <i>saa</i> appeared)."
