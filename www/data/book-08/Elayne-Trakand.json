{"id":"Elayne-Trakand","name":"Elayne Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1: To Keep the Bargain","info":"<a class='name' name='Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, p. 47 (40)&#x2014;The Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. She is the daughter of <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase</a> and her late husband, Taringail, and sister to <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>. She is also half-sister to Galad, although she would rather not be reminded of this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not really like him. She has considerable potential in the One Power, and is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more, possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene</a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a>, <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>, and some Sea Folk trainees. She has red-gold curly hair. During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne realized she loved <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and told him how she felt; he felt similarly. She had no idea at the time what <a href='#Min'>Min</a> meant about &#x201C;having to share him,&#x201D; but now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads, indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha</a>, and they with him. Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only Accepted) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life. Elayne is currently in Ebou Dar, looking for the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that she believes will fix the weather. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>; <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
