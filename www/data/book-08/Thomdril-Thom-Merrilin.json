            "info": "<a class='name' name='Thom'>Thomdril (Thom) Merrilin</a>, p. 130 (136)&#x2014;A gleeman who came to Emond&apos;s Field on Winternight just before the Trollocs came. He is quite the ladies&apos; man. Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks. He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread from Thom to <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Min'>Min</a>, and <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>. Thom was originally a bard in <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal Court, and for a time after her husband Taringail Damodred died, he was the Queen&apos;s lover. During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of it. Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he cannott do the backflips and other stunts he used to do. He accompanied <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve</a> on their travels as per <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine</a>&apos;s request, despite the fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah. Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried Dena was killed by Cairhienin soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i> against the Royal House. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Morgase'>Trakand, Morgase</a>.
