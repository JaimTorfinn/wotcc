She is first-sister to <a href='#Chiad'>Chiad</a>, of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak through the camp of the other to find the Wise Ones to become first sisters, since their clans were in blood feud at the time. She is now one of the Maidens who accompanies <a href='#Faile'>Faile</a>, a similar honor guard to what <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> has, although smaller and for different reasons. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Chiad'>Chiad</a>.
