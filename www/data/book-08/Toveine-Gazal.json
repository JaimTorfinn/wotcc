She is short and plump with smooth, coppery skin and long, glossy dark hair and dark eyes. She was given twenty years penance, and spent fifteen years away from the Tower until <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> summoned her back to active service. She was formerly a Sitter for the Red. Elaida named her to lead the team of fifty sisters that she sent to Caemlyn to attempt to capture any men who can channel that they find; unfortunately, she vastly underestimated their numbers, and the entire team will most likely be killed or captured in minutes once the Asha&apos;man realize what they intend to do. It is too late to call her back, however. "
