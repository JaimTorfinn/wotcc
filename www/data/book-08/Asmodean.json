            "info": "<a class='name' name='Asmodean'>Asmodean</a>, p. 485 (551)&#x2014;One of the Forsaken. He was born Joar Addam Nessosin in the then coastal city of Shorelle, a child prodigy in music and art. He gave his life to the Shadow in exchange for the immortality he received, so he could study and perfect his music. After being released from the Bore, he was coerced by Lanfear into coming with her, eventually to teach <a href='#Rand'>Rand</a> to channel without killing himself. Asmodean was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of <i>angreal</i>, <i>ter&apos;angreal</i>, and most especially the two white statue <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that linked the holder to the great <i>sa&apos;angreal</i> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together could Break the World beyond repair. He went there to obtain the male statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One</a>. He then became Rand&apos;s teacher, and went into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if they saw him. He was killed by someone of unknown identity right after <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> and Lanfear were killed/trapped. "
