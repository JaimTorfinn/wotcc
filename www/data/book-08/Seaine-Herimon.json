When the Hall was arguing over who to raise as <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin</a> years back, it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or more years than were common. Seaine suggested <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche</a>, then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for ten years; she was eventually raised. Recently, Seaine has been assigned by <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a> to &#x201C;follow the stench of treason, no matter where it leads or how high, even to the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper</a> herself.&#x201D; Seaine interpreted this to mean that she was to root out Darkfriends in the Tower. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Talene'>Minly, Talene</a>; <a href='#Pevara'>Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.
