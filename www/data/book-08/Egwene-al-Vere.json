            "info": "<a class='name' name='Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, p. 60 (55)&#x2014;A young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a> among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida</a>. She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand</a>, the <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, Galad and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene shows promise to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. <i>See also</i> <a href='#Rand'>al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>; <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href='#Nynaeve'>Mandragoran, Nynaeve ti al&apos;Meara</a>; <a href='#Elaida'>a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>; <a href='#Elayne'>Trakand, Elayne</a>; <a href='#Gawyn'>Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
